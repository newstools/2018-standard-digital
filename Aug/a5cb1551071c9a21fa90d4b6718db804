Speaking during commissioning of the Impala-Dunga road, Nyong’o gave the contractors the permission to demolish any structure that may interfere with the road construction process. “Right now the environment committee is in place, and the law must be implemented. Bring down anything that may hinder the construction of this road. Should anyone complain tell them to come to my office," he said. Nyong’o said that the city projects had delayed because there was no city management board that is now in place. Most projects, he added, had been affected by cases of corruption and impunity.  "Proper planning is needed to ensure development projects are realized," said Nyong’o Just like Nairobi, there are several buildings put up along the river banks and the shores of Lake Victoria. Most likely to be demolished are houses built on the swampy stretch near the lake. ALSO READ:
