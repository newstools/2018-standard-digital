When he declines, the assault continues with the woman threatening not to stop until he pays up. Mr Haji, through the official Twitter handle of the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions, requested for information about the sickening episode. “Calling on the public to provide details of this incident i.e. perpetrator, location and date to inform appropriate action," read the tweet that was posted Sunday. The tweet sparked a huge debate with some men accusing the DPP of not doing enough to address incidents of violence against men while others thanked Haji for taking action.  “Your action is commendable. Gender-based violence should not be condoned and should not be seen to favour one gender in terms of actions," one tweet said.
