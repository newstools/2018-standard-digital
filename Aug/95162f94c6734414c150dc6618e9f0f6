Speaking during the annual judges' conference in Mombasa yesterday, Maraga criticised MPs for slashing the Judiciary's budget, adding that they were punishing courts for judgements against the Legislature. “Speedy trials are fundamental, integral right for all citizens. Backlog of cases is the manifestation of denial of justice for victims. We have seen cases where victims remain in remand longer during the trial period than even their imprisonment,” he said.
