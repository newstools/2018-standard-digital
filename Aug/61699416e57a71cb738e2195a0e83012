According to the chairman of the operators Steve Ochuka, the passengers turned against the operator with crude weapons before escaping from the scene. The seriously injured operator was later taken to Gilgil sub-county hospital where he died on Monday morning while undergoing treatment.  “This is the fifth case in Gilgil where an operator has been hired, attacked, robbed and murdered but no arrest has been made and hence our anger,” he said. Ochuka added that in all the cases, the operators were hit by blunt objects on the back of the head and the motorcycle stolen. “Four months ago, we recovered the body of one of the operators after a three day search and we believe that this is the same group that is involved in these murders,” he said. Gilgil MP Martha Wangari called on police to work with the operators in seeking and arresting the culprits. ALSO READ:
