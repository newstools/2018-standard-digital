He further highlighted the plight of youth who indulge in drug abuse in full glare of the security personnel, as a way of demonstrating incompetence on law enforcers. Adan said he will advocate for the construction of a rehabilitation center either by the CDF or national government. Elwak Acting Deputy County Commissioner Paul Kemei requested the local residents to come out and alert the security agents of any alarming danger to enable his team to move fast in tracking and curbing any terrorist before disaster strikes.
