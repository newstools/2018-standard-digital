Desai gave road construction and equipment for testing bricks, soil and timber strength. "If we have equipment to test our work, we are able to refine our curriculum so that we qualify for international standards," he said. Desai said moving from theoretical to practical examinations in vocational training institutions would increase competencies and boost enterprises.  The PS said standardising courses and equipment in TVETs would create a good link with small businesses. “Micro, small and medium sector is a sleeping giant and we need to awaken just by increasing the level of innovation and training," he added.
