Navakholo MP Emanuel Wangwe has asked Deputy President William Ruto to be sincere with the recently shot down committee report on the seized illegal sugar. This is after Mr Ruto questioned the report saying it had implicated the wrong people instead of going after the real barons behind the illegal importation. ALSO READ:

I think the Deputy President is too busy to read the report comprehensively," said the MP who blamed the DPs advisers by saying they could be sleeping on job by not doing their work right. Wangwe who is the parliamentary Agriculture Committee deputy chairman wondered why Ruto was defending the Treasury Cabinet Secretary Henry Rotich, and his EAC counterpart Adan Mohamed. “We are sorry because if that is the direction we are going to lead a government by frustrating a farmer, then it is wrong and we must look for a solution,” said Wangwe.  The legislator emphasized how they will not be cowed to expose the truth and said sugar at Webuye, 59 bags, and at Airbase had mercury contents and it is clearly shown in the attachments in the report. On his part, Devolution Cabinet Secretary Eugene Wamalwa said the sugar matter had become weighty and could no-longer be left to parliament alone and that they are looking at the possibility to try alternative ways outside parliament.
