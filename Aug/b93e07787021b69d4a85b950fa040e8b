 Lands Cabinet Secretary Farida Karoney has appointed a task force to come up with guidelines on how to implement electronic land transactions, registration and conveyancing. Ms Karoney (pictured) gazetted the 15-member team on Friday. The task force will be chaired by Geospatial Information Management Surveyors chairman Eric Nyadimo. Karoney made the appointments after the ministry reached an agreement with the Law Society of Kenya (LSK), which sued her ministry when it sought to implement the electronic land transactions in April. “One of the things we agreed do together (with LSK) is to put up a task force to come up with the regulations,” she said.
