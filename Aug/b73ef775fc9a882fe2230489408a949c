Area Chief Samuel Obado said Mr Odhiambo’s wife, Pauline Adhiambo, escaped with minor injuries on her legs. “The public confronted one of the suspects but he was later rescued by police officers who had rushed to the scene,” said Obado. The chief blamed the incident on some non-locals who have been “hiding in beaches pretending to be fishermen, yet they were committing crimes at night”.  He directed the Beach Management Unit leadership to vet all fishermen and record their details to help weed out criminals.
