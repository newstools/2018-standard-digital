According to Kinoti, the following day a call will be made and someone will pretend to be an attendant at the DHL office.

That is the time you realize that you have been conned. This is therefore to warn members of the general public against such fraudsters,” he said. The swoop followed a barrage of complaints filed with police over the incidents. One victim told police he had been promised an Iphone and paid Sh70,000 for the gadget. During the swoop, several electronic gadgets were recovered from the suspects’ houses. Some of the suspects had come to Nairobi as students and as businessmen. ALSO READ:
