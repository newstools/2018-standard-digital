A policeman killed during a suspected Al Shabaab attack on a vehicle convoy in Lamu County last week has been eulogised as a diligent, quiet and jovial officer. Bedatine Kudoyis was an officer at the Mpeketoni police station but was killed on Wednesday last week in an ambush blamed on Islamic militants who attacked a truck at Milihoi laden with prisoners coming from court. OCPD Christopher Limo who worked with Kudoyis described the deceased as a hero who died defending himself and protecting the peace. "The officer had tried repulsing the attackers, he had shot at them but he was trapped in the mud and this gave the attackers a chance to kill him. To me he is a hero,” said Limo. The deceased will be buried in Nambale, Busia County on Saturday and leaves behind a widow and a child. The county AP commandant Perminus Kioi also described the deceased as a friendly officer who was well mannered, an officer who also listened to advises.  The other officers were from Hindi G.K prison where they had taken prisoners from Mpeketoni Law court, the other officers have been accounted for.
