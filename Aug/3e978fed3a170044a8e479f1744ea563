Regional integration The project, which runs from Kapchorwa town to Suam on the Ugandan side and Suam to Kitale and then to Eldoret by-pass at Leseru on the Kenyan side, will take over five years to complete. Deputy President William Ruto said at Kapchorwa last weekend the road would be a key enabler to regional integration and would attract investors and boost both imports and exports between the two countries. “Trade collaborations between Kenya and Uganda as well as capital investments will result in new, diversified income streams and strengthen the two countries,” said Mr Ruto.
