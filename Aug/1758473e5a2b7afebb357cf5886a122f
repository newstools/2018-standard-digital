State now targets ranches in Mau State Bank of Mauritius (SBM) had issued a Sh19.5 billion loan to a consortium that owns Kwale Sugar, a deal that came out in the public domain after SBM Chief Executive Raj Dussoye resigned. Sources said Kwale Sugar failed to register security for half of the loan which was guaranteed through a mortgage. The rest of the loan had been guaranteed through US dollar deposits. Things came to a head after it emerged that the title deed might have been forged, putting into focus the due diligence of the lender’s boss. Declared guarantor “Although the Kenyan Government, after the outbreak of the case, declared guarantor of the loan from the Kenyan company, the reports of BDO (Binder Dijker Otte) and EY (Ernst & Young) are considered sufficiently overwhelming,” reported L’Express, a Mauritian French-language daily.

The CEO resigned after it became difficult to recover the Sh6 billion (4.2 billion Indian rupees) from the Kenyan group, Pabari Investment, and another Sh1.3 billion (942 million Indian rupees) from a Dubai broker. The family-run investment group, Pabari Investments Ltd, owns Kwale Sugar Company Ltd, which partnered with a Mauritius firm, Omnicane Ltd, for a 25 per cent stake. The story broke as SBM was about to clinch the deal for Chase Bank, which had been in receivership since April 2016. ALSO READ:
