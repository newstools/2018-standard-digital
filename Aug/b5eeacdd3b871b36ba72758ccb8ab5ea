The emotive debate over Mau Forest evictions has taken an unprecedented turn with lawyers representing some 40,000 families now invoking the attention of The Hague-based International Criminal Court (ICC). In a letter dated August 3 to the Office of The Prosecutor at the International Criminal Court, law firm Sigey arap Bett and Company Advocates says the deportation and forcible transfer of civilian populations around the Mau is contrary to Article7 of the Rome Statute.

The Mau evictions have been a thorn in the flesh of various administrations over the past 10 years, each attempting eviction but ultimately reneging on the decision. It is believed that in the run-up to the 2013 elections, the Mau debate caused Opposition chief Raila Odinga votes in the Rift Valley.

It also alleges that the government has watched from the sidelines as local leaders whip up emotions. The ICC is, however, not obligated to act on the letter. It is also not clear whether the evidence alluded to by the law firm will reach the threshold required by the ICC or whether such matters fall under the international court’s jurisdiction.
