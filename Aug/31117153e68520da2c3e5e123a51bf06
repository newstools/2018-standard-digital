Ruto breaks silence on Mau evictions Kenya Forest Service eco-system conservator Francis Misonge issued Embomos Tea Farm and Sinendet Multi-Purpose Co-operative Society with notices to vacate the land. County Commissioner Geoffrey Omonding (pictured) said the two firms, based in Konoin constituency, were illegally occupying Mau Forest land. Mr Omonding said the vacate order was in line with ongoing efforts to conserve forests. "The decision to evict them was reached after a county security committee on environment found they had illegally acquired the land to grow tea," he said. “We have written to them to move out and invited the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission and Directorate of Criminal Investigations to investigate the matter further and bring to book those who carried out illegal land transfers that led to destruction of parts of the forest.
