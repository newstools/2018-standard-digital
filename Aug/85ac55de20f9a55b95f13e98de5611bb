Oshwal Centre welcomes demolitions on its property The team on Monday said it will now concentrate on flattening structures that were partially brought down last week. They plan to complete the demolition of Oshwal Centre, Ukay Centre and Southend Mall. The task force’s operations manager Julius Wanjau yesterday said the partially destroyed buildings posed a danger to residents. Mr Wanjau also said they have shelved their plan to use explosives to flatten the structures as this would affect neighboring buildings. Avoid becoming a victim of Fake News.

We would rather take our time and complete the demolitions,” he said. The demolitions, aimed at reclaiming Nairobi River, began last week and are expected to continue for the next two months. Some 4,000 buildings are targeted. Last week, Oshwal Centre's perimeter wall was brought down and part of its premises located on riparian land were scheduled to be destroyed yesterday. Wanjau, however, said the task force had given Oshwal’s management four more days to destroy the property. ALSO READ:
