Wife wins 10-year battle to bury her female 'husband' Ms Kulei had gone to court to block the burial of Margaret Sayaya on the suit land. She sued a brother of the deceased, John Sayaya, and her in-laws, Jonathan Saning’o and Jackson Kipkemoi. In the suit filed two months ago, Kulei claimed that burying the body on her farm was illegal and prejudicial. She said she acquired the land in 1997 through a Government settlement scheme. Mr Sayaya, Mr Saning’o and Mr Kipkemoi, in their reply, insisted that Kulei did not own the land.  Null and void They contended that the registration was fraudulently done and was, therefore, null and void. They told the court that the deceased was the rightful owner of the suit land, having been allocated the parcel in 1997. Kulei, while giving her evidence earlier, had informed the court that she resides in Baringo and that her land had been illegally taken by the deceased. She produced a title deed, a certificate of search and an allotment letter. She informed the court that she had reported the trespass to the chief, but he had not taken any action. ALSO READ:
