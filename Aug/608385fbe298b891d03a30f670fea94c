President Uhuru Kenyatta recently caused a stir following a statement he made about Deputy President William Ruto during an event in Nairobi’s Embakasi East area. The President said in Swahili “Hii kijana anaitwa Ruto unajua kila weekend anatangatanga kila mahali… atakua anapitia hizi machorochoro”, loosely translated to; this young man called Ruto, you know he likes roaming everywhere every weekend.
