According to the performance report, the average container dwell time was at 3.4 days compared to 3.8 days last year. The dwell time is the period containers stay at the marine terminal upon offloading from the container ship. Vessels turnaround time was 4.5 days compared to 3.8 days last year during the same month. The drop is attributable to the disruptions during the delivery of port handling equipment in June.
