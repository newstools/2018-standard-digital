Of the 29 per cent who say that they have some spare cash left, claim to spend this cash on improving the conditions of their families such as buying furniture and electrical gadgets before putting the rest into savings. When asked about their biggest concern over the next six months, the highest number of Kenyans interviewed for the CCI score - 16 per cent – responded that the prices of food worry them more than anything else. The prices of food worry them more than the education and general welfare of their children which comes at 13 per cent.  Only 11 per cent are worried about the state of the country’s economy, while 12 per cent are worried about having a work and life balance. Despite the observations, the Nielsen research noted that the CCI score for Quarter 2, 2018 showed an improvement of two points standing at 106 points, compared to the 104 score in the same quarter in 2017.
