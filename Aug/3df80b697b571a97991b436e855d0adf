The fight against communicable diseases in schools and villages has got impetus in Suba South Constituency after completion of Sh15.2m water projects. The four water projects which include; God Oloo, Bunge, Miriya and Nyadenda have been constructed through drilling of bore holes and piping to schools and villages via solar energy. Area MP John Mbadi who launched the projects yesterday said they were funded by the National Government Constituency Development Fund (NGCDF). Mbadi said the aim of the projects was to cushion students and pupils in the area from contracting waterborne infections. Each of the wells has been drilled near a secondary school. “Our schools and the surrounding communities have been suffering from acute water shortage and I realized this could lead to loss of lives,” said Mbadi. He said each of the water projects was targeting at least 100 households. “We were targeting schools but we realized that the community had no water. We had to supply the water to the community because that is where the students also hail from,” said Mbadi. Stay informed while on the go by subscribing to the Standard Group SMS service.

Area residents expressed optimism that the projects were a sigh of relief from perennial water shortage that had afflicted them. “We have been spending at least 2 hours to get a bucket of water due to long distance from the previous water source. This project is a sigh of relief for us,” said Margaret Otuma, 61 year old resident of God Oloo village.
