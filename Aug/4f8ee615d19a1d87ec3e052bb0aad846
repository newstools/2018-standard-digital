  Landowners of the controversial Kibarani dumpsite yesterday failed to turn up for a public hearing convened by the land commission. The National Land Commission (NLC), which was expecting 21 private entities to attend, warned it would make far-reaching recommendations that could see the owners lose their property. ALSO READ:

Pressure piles on NLC bosses to resign Eight owners turned up at the Kenya School of Government but only Multiple ICD Ltd and Makupa Transit Company were heard even as NLC acting chairperson Abigael Mbagaya called out the names of those who were absent. Ms Mbagaya said they were investigating 30 plots in Kibarani following a directive by President Uhuru Kenyatta that those found to have benefited from illegal allocations would lose the land. “NLC is carrying out investigations of the land allocation based on available information from the county and national governments so as to make appropriate recommendations. Those snubbing public hearings by the commission are not making matters better,” she warned. She said the law allowed affected title deed holders to appear before the commission before any decision was taken.  The commission is also investigating more than 30 acres belonging the Veterinary Department, which is located next to the sea in Kibarani. Ms Mbagaya said efforts to repossess the Kibarani land were aimed at "restoring the face of the island that was many years back recognised as a world heritage site". She indicated NLC would extend its investigations to other areas on the seafront, including a lighthouse and grabbed fish landing sites. The hearing continues from 9.30am today with site visits to the Kibarani dumpsite and the lighthouse. ALSO READ:
