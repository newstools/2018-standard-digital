Prison official arrested over Sh12.5m While expressing their anger, parents of the pupils asked the police to investigate the matter and make sure the ‘rapist’ pays for his mistakes. “My daughter came home and after observing her I asked her what was wrong, she told she was in pain and decided to check her only to find out that she has been raped” said one of the parents. "We were called by the school administration only to be informed that our children have been raped" added one of the parents. Leaders from the area, chairman of the Nyumba kumi initiative Muhanji Alusa and leader for women association of Shinyalu, Feronica Chausiku and Judith Ereko have condemned the act saying the victim must pay.  “I urge parents not to leave the children alone since someone can decide to kill them. I urge the community to outcast those defiling children to protect the girl child” said Chausiku. They now want the government to do away with registration fees on P3 forms since it is expensive and scares away many from reporting and getting justice. “I encourage the government to scrap off the registration fee on P3 forms on school rape cases since poor parents cannot afford and the criminal to be locked away and doctors from coming to testify” said Muhanji. However Shinyalu O C P, Mr Makau told the standard on phone that the children had not been raped. ALSO READ:
