A student who dropped out of the university and dug trenches to raise school fees now has a reason to smile. After William Tsuma's story was highlighted in The Standard on June 14, well-wishers donated money for the 23-year-old to continue studies at Technical University of Mombasa. Lucy Wanjiku, a well-wisher, shared Tsuma's story among fellow engineers, who then began to raise funds. Tsuma was a second-year Civil Engineering student when he quit last year. “So far Sh161, 800 has been realised and the Transformed IEK members continue to send contributions and share his story on social media,” said Ms Wanjiku. Tsuma needs more than Sh600, 000 for the remaining four years. Know if news is factual and true. Text 'NEWS' to 22840 and always receive verified news updates.
