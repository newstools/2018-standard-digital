A further 54 people were sentenced to five years in prison over the killings of at least 20 people, while 22 were acquitted. Defense lawyers and relatives of the accused were present for the verdict, but the defendants were not in court. A picture posted by the ministry showed two guards with large guns standing close to black-robed judges inside the courtroom.
