Word that Google is crafting a search engine to meet China's draconian censorship rules has sparked widespread employee anger at the company which has responded by limiting workers' access to documents about the project, a report said Friday.

"There's been total radio silence from leadership, which is making a lot of people upset and scared. â€¦ Our internal meme site and Google Plus are full of talk, and people are a.n.g.r.y." Google withdrew its search engine from China eight years ago due to censorship and hacking but it is now working on a project for the country codenamed "Dragonfly," an employee told AFP on condition of anonymity.

US internet titans have long struggled with doing business in China, home of a "Great Firewall" that blocks politically sensitive content, such as the 1989 Tiananmen massacre. Twitter, Facebook, YouTube and The New York Times website are blocked in China, but Microsoft's Bing search engine continues to operate. In early 2010, Google shut down its search engine in mainland China after rows over censorship and hacking. Google had cried foul over what it said were cyber attacks aimed at its source code and the Gmail accounts of Chinese human rights activists. ALSO READ:
