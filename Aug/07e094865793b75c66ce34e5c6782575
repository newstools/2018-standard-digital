The bodies of two boys who vanished during an excursion to River Rupingazi in Embu County on Sunday have been found. The bodies of Emmanuel Murimi, 17, and his 14-year-old cousin, Alex Mwenda, were found trapped among underwater roots, about six kilometres downstream from the point where their bicycle and clothes were found. According to divers, the two were clinging to one another when they drowned, with Murimi (pictured) fully clothed, leading to speculation that he died trying to save his cousin. The boys disappeared shortly after attending church and did not return home. One of their friends later said they were overheard saying they were heading to the river. The recovery ended a more than 72-hour wait for the two families as rescuers searched the river for the boys. Avoid fake news!
