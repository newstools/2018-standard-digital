The widow Ann Muthoni said Nyuguto had just parked his motorcycle in the compound and proceeded to his coffee farm to check on casual workers when he was shot dead. She said the chief had complained of having received death threats several times. The unionist blamed Nyuguto’s death on war against rising crime in the village and illicit brews, saying he was a vocal campaigner against the two vices.  Nyeri Central OCPD Muinde Kioko boss said investigations into the killing had been launched. Mr Kioko said the killers did not steal anything from the chief or his family. Nyuguto is the second chief to be shot dead in Nyeri County. Two years ago, Chief Martin Githinji of Ichuga location in Kieni East was killed by unknown gunmen at his home. ALSO READ:
