 NAIROBI, KENYA: A Kenyan has clinched the top seat at the African Telecommunications Union (ATU), which is Africa Union’s specialised agency on telecommunications. John Omo was elected Secretary General of ATU with 23 votes, beating his sole challenger, Burundi’s Mr. Constaque Hakizimana who managed two votes at elections held last week during the 5th Ordinary Session of the ATU Plenipotentiary conference in Nairobi. He said his work would entail positioning ATU as the sole voice of ICT matters on the continent. Omo added that he would leverage on the foundation established by his predecessor Mr.Abdoulkarim Soumaila to ensure the continent reaps the massive benefits ICTs present for the region’s socio-economic development. ‘‘I undertake to build on the good work of my predecessor to take this organization to the next level,’’ added Mr.Omo. During the session in the day the delegates endorsed Kenya to continue the temporary hosting of the ATU headquarters for the next four years, until a decision is made on the permanent location of the Union’s seat.

The ATU was originally based in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) but was relocated to Kenya in 1999 due to the prevailing political instability. It was expected that the Plenipotentiary Conference would ratify a proposal to have the seat permanently hosted in Kenya, but DRC has requested for more time to prepare to host the seat.
