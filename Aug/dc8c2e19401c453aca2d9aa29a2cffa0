The witnesses said they were cautioned against sharing the information with anyone. They said they wanted to tell the head boy but never got a chance because of school rules. “We came from the evening preps late. We had been cautioned against moving around that night so we could not go to the head boy’s cubicle to share the information with him." They were testifying in a case in which five Form Two students have been charged with burning down the school store valued at Sh116,000 on July 15. The five had initially pleaded guilty to the charge only to deny it after four days in custody. They are out on a bond of Sh80,000. ALSO READ:
