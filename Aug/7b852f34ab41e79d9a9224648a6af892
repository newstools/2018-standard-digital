He praised the community-based model embraced in Laikipia to enrol residents, saying it was effective and worth emulating by other counties. “We are excited with Laikipia because it has been able to identify those who are able to pay for NHIF and those who cannot,” said Muhuhu. He noted that getting data on poor households made it easier to come up with mechanisms to ensure that they were put on a subsidised enrolment.
