[PHOTO: KEVIN TUNOI ] Likuyani Constituency Member of Parliament Enoch Kibunguchy’s driver was shot dead recently.  According to Kibunguchy’s, the bullet that felled his driver was meant for him. He has gone as far as alleging he knows who are involved with the attempt on his life. ALSO READ:

How Opposition MP escaped hitman's bullet Though the motive is not yet clear, the assumption is that Kibunguchy has made a detailed report of his suspicions to the police for follow up action. Any other ordinary criminal would have perhaps given up after the initial murder attempt, but surprisingly, that has not been the case. At the burial of Kibunguchy’s driver in Trans Nzoia County Monday this week, there was more gun drama as criminals yet again made another attempt at Mr Kibunguchy, but ended up injuring a number of mourners, among them Kibunguchy’s bodyguard and Tongaren MP Eseli Simiyu. While the police claim bodyguards to some dignitaries started the melee, Bungoma Senator Moses Wetangula avers he saw a police officer in uniform open fire on mourners.  The truth must be ascertained.  These attacks should not be taken just like any other criminal act. There could be underlying causes that unless urgently addressed, could result in more deaths. Incidences in which gun wielding criminals because despondency cannot be entertained. Thus, it behoves the police to act with speed to arrest and charge those responsible for the heinous acts. The need for tightening gun control laws cannot be overemphasised as we also urge the government to provide enhanced security for leaders.
