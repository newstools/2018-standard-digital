"The sector is recovering well from the effects of travel advisories that negatively impacted our economy over the years." Mwasambu said the resurgence of tourism was courtesy of a collaboration between the county government and other stakeholders, including those in the security and hospitality sectors. He said the county government set aside Sh20 million in the current financial year to help improve the sector.  ALSO READ:
