He further added that life is so precious and it should be protected as well as respected at all cost. “This is a moral decay behavior in the society. Family members should not direct their anger towards their children whenever they are distressed or having disagreements with their partners but rather finding a better way to solve their issues,” added Omanga. He further added that caution will be taken to the members of the public who might be subjected to commit the same act. ALSO READ:
