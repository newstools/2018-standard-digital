Tragedy as man burns his elderly parents to death Peter David Leparakwo told the National Assembly’s Public Investment Committee that he inherited the land from a white settler company  by the name A.J Faulkner and sons Limited. The 76-year-old said he and other four others were given the land — through a letter to the Lands ministry — as a token of appreciation for working for Mr Faulkner for years. Mr Leparakwo is among seven people claiming ownership of the disputed land that NHIF claims it bought from Kaskazi Limited in 2002. “We were given the land by Faulkner who was a white settler. We were staying (sic) in Kitale and relocated to Karen and when there was an attempted coup in 1982, Faulkner decided to go back to his country and left for his workers the piece of land,” said Leparakwo.
