During the session, some members accused the county assembly leaders of failing to fast-track implementation of some of the laws adopted since they came into office. The MCAs who were opposed to Oloo’s removal told The Standard, on condition of anonymity, that the impeachment plans were a publicity stunt by some of their colleagues. “The grounds for Oloo’s impeachment were not strong enough and the motion could have been easily dismissed by the courts. We were not expecting it to go through,” said one MCA. Mr Kanga started the debate two weeks ago, when he vowed to table the motion before the House. He said he would rally members to support it and ensure that Oloo was removed. ALSO READ:
