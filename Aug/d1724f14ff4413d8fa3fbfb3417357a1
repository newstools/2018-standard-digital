Girl cries when told to identify suspect State counsel Joan Tarus asked the court to issue an order, directing the accused to provide DNA samples after the complainant delivered a baby girl. In her sworn testimony yesterday, the young mother told court the accused enticed her with books which he asked her to pick from his house in April last year. “I was in Standard Eight by then while the accused was in Form Four. He told me to accompany him to their home to pick some text books which were necessary for my admission to secondary school since he did not need them,” she said. To her shock, the accused dragged her into his room and forced her to have sex with him, she told Kakamega Resident Magistrate William Lopokoiyit. “I tried to resist but he was too strong for me. He defiled me despite my repeated pleas to stop. He later released me without the books,” she said. Know if news is factual and true. Text 'NEWS' to 22840 and always receive verified news updates.
