The co-chair of the National Assembly joint committee that investigated seized sugar stocks has defended the discredited report tabled Wednesday in Parliament. In a long tirade, Kieni MP Kanini Kega who chairs the Committee on Agriculture fought back against criticism that the committee had doctored the report to favour some of the sugar barons who had a hand in the illegal imports.

CS Rotich in trouble for snubbing MPs over sugar “Our report is indicting the high and mighty even within government. Those implicated are trying very hard to scuttle the probe,” he said. Kanini, who was speaking in Nyeri at the weekend, said that it was an endorsement to the independence of the committee that they indicted Cabinet secretaries Henry Rotich (Treasury), Adan Mohammed (EAC) and former Agriculture CS Willy Bett. “We are the first committee chaired by members of Jubilee Party to find sitting Cabinet Secretaries culpable. We should be congratulated rather than censured,” he said. On Thursday, MPs alleged that there was a plot to protect the culpable individuals by altering the report to leave out scared cows.

Among the recommendations of the committee is that the CSs take responsibility for their actions and inaction which led to the importation of the illegal sugar. However, the MP denied that the sugar in the country had heavy metals. "Surveillance from 45 counties has shown that aside from higher levels of moisture, the sugar is safe," he said. He said they were disappointed that the Government Chemist had failed to appear before the committee that he co-chairs with Mandera South Mp Adan Haji to vouch for a report tabled by the Ministry of Health which stated that there was Mercury and Lead in some of the samples.
