Swazuri, Atanas deny corruption charges William Kamau Tsango, who was convicted by Mombasa Chief Magistrate Julius Nang’ea in April this year, was set free yesterday after Justice Erick Ogola gave the appellant bond. "This is a very serious offence. Why should you enter consent to release the appellant on a bond of Sh100,000? In fact, the appellant has no right to bail,” the judge said. The prosecution said it is troubling to free the appellant on a Sh100,000 bond, noting that it had proposed a Sh200,000 bond. But Kamau’s lawyer, Titus Mugambi, insisted that his client should be released on the Sh100,000 bond he had agreed with the DPP. Know if news is factual and true.

Mr Mugambi said the appellant was arrested six months after the incident because the father reported the matter to a senior government official who intervened. “I am releasing you on a bond of Sh100,000 because the prosecution has entered into a consent for your release on bond pending appeal,” said Justice Ogola. Mr Nang'ea found Kamau guilty of defiling the girl at Majengo Mapya in Likoni. He acquitted him of an alternative offence of indecent assault and said the prosecution had proved its case beyond reasonable doubt. ALSO READ:
