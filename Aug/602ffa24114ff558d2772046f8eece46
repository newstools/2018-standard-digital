Help at last for poor varsity dropout Last week, the county assembly health committee brought up the matter to the assembly, saying the addictive stimulant was destroying the lives of many youths in the area. On Monday, hundreds of 'muguka' traders in Mombasa protested after county inspectorate teams pushed them out of Tononoka grounds that serves as the main distribution point for the stimulant in the city. Close to 80 stalls were flattened as the county moved to scuttle the sale of the highly addictive stimulant. But the traders accused county officials of unfairly targeting them claiming their business was legal.  They accused the county officials of not getting priorities right by going after 'muguka' instead of hard drugs. The traders further questioned why the county inspectorate collected Sh30 daily from each dealer if indeed the business was illegal. However, County Inspectorate Director Mohammed Amir defended his department, saying it acted on orders from the health department. He said the health department had complained that 'muguka' business was being conducted near schools, making it easier for students to access the stimulant. ALSO READ:
