We are looking forward to bridging the gap between the high and low tourism seasons," said Mr Tunai. The governor, who also chairs the tourism committee in the Council of Governors, noted that there was need to market the Mara beyond the annual wildebeest migration. He revealed that it had been a challenge to keep a steady stream of tourists flocking to the game reserve especially during the off-season. Thompson Reuters Senior Vice President, Sales and Content, Munira Ibrahim said the media outlet was privileged to partner with the county and they were up to the task of telling stories about the Mara.  “As Reuters we are privileged to partner with the County of Narok and Maasai Mara game reserve.
