According to Western Kenya EACC head Ben Murei, prosecution of a second officer implicated in the bribery ring would depend on availability of witnesses. The seized officer is said to have asked for Sh20,000 as inducement to drop investigations into defilement claims against a suspect. He was given Sh10,000 as down payment. Unknown to the suspect, EACC officials had laid a trap leading to the arrest, as he received the money. “A brother of the suspect came to us and told us the officer was asking for Sh20,000 to prevent the matter from proceeding to court for criminal prosecution. We gave him treated money, which we used to trap the officer,” said Mr Murei. Know if news is factual and true. Text 'NEWS' to 22840 and always receive verified news updates.
