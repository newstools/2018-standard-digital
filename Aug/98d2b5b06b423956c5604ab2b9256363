When Omollo arrived at the scene, he found that his mother had locked herself in a burning house. He broke the door and entered the house to save her. However, some materials fell on them before they moved out of the fire. “Both of them were overwhelmed by the fire which burnt them beyond recognition,” said Ongere.  The administrator said efforts by neighbours to rescue the grandmother and her son proved futile. “I liaised with the police officers who removed the bodies to Rachuonyo South Sub County Hospital mortuary as investigations commence,” he added.
