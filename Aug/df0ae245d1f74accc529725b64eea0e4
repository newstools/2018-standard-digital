Led by its party leader Ekuru Aukot, it has termed the six-month long unity pact between President Uhuru Kenyatta and Opposition leader Raila Odinga as a “directionless, confusing and unconstitutional body.” ALSO READ:

Coup plot in Jubilee unearthed In a statement seen by the Standard Digital, part of the concerns raised were that, the building bridges taskforce was a void agreement between the President and an individual and as such did not represent the public interest. “It is a wasteful expenditure,” read part of the statement. Ekuru also said that the 14-member taskforce was not vetted as is required constitutionally. “Kenyans are neither aware of their competencies to serve and deliver on their purpoted roles. In fact, even going by some political lamentation from some political quarters, the taskforce is not even inclusive. So, how can it build bridges when it started on the wrong footing?” he posed. The party has now implored government to immediately dissolve the taskforce so as to save the public any unnecessary financial costs that may be accrued in the process. This turnaround comes just a day after President Uhuru Kenyatta dismissed allegations that the handshake between him and Raila Odinga was a form of a political pact, adding that “it had a much deeper understanding” than meets-the-eye.
