The Government last year imported six million 90kg bags of maize from Mexico, Uganda, Zambia, Ethiopia and other destinations to tame an acute food crisis that followed the prolonged drought.  The Devolution and Agriculture ministries confirmed that various players, including smallholder farmers, transporters and millers, had yet to be paid, but added that they would be paid when funds were available. Devolution Cabinet Secretary Eugene Wamalwa said the Government was fast-tracking the payment of debts, with small-scale farmers set to be paid in the next 21 days. The farmers are owed Sh1.4 billion. The Government has also not paid millers Sh2.24 billion for the maize flour subsidy programme. ALSO READ:
