Ex-county officials spend night in custody Mr John Mate, a contractor, criticised the county government for reverting to the manual system of revenue collection. "Other counties have embraced electronic revenue collection. That is why I don't understand why our government has stopped using the digital platform, which had been functioning well for years. Loss of revenue to corrupt officials will derail the county's development agenda," said Mate yesterday.

Wawira Njue, from Embu County Urban Forum, called on the county to employ more doctors and nurses, to end shortage at the Embu Level Five Hospital.
