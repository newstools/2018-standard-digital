Keiyo elders on Friday conducted cursing rituals in Kerio Valley ostensibly to inflict pain and suffering on grabbers of their ancestral land. The half-dressed, grey-haired elderly men from the Kongot community slaughtered an unblemished goat at dawn and spilled its blood on the ground while chanting traditional rituals. The goat’s carcass was left in the open untouched. ALSO READ:

Kenya Railways to name land grabbers The elders claim that their 650 hectares at Chemurgui in Keiyo South sub-county has been grabbed, registered and subdivided to 40 wealthy individuals who are now living and farming on it. “We have decided to conduct the rituals as a last resort after our numerous trips to land offices and sub-county administrators to seek audience failed. Nature will intervene on our behalf and the grabbers will enjoy no peace until they surrender the land to us," said Kongot community chairman Joel Kiptunoi. He said they want their land back since they have been rendered squatters. “Our forefather, Kongot, had six sons whose descendants have since multiplied to over 10,000 people. The worst part is majority of them cannot fend for their families because they have no land and have been accommodated by relatives since their land has been grabbed,” said Mr Kiptunoi.  Majority of land in Kerio valley is communally owned through clans and lack registration documents.
