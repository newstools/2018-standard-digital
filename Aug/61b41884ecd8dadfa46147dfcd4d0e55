Three people were killed and one critically wounded in an explosion when their vehicle set off a crude landmine in El Wak, Mandera County. El Wak Deputy County Commissioner Paul Kemei said the four passengers, who are yet to be identified, were part of a team working on the security wall being built on the Kenya-Somalia border.

Militants kill five soldiers in Lamu explosion Mr Kemei said the men were headed towards the construction site when the improvised device exploded. “The victims have been clearing a road along the security wall and were hit by what we suspect to be an improvised explosive device,” Kemei said. The deputy county commissioner added that the explosive must have been planted early in the morning by  Al-Shabaab militants. He said those working on the wall were usually guarded by security officers and escorted to the site, but this particular team had left without a security detail.  He said investigations were underway to establish why the contractor and his men left for the site unaccompanied. Kenya announced it would build a security wall to prevent Al-Shabaab militants from getting into the country, following the deadly April 2, 2015 attack at Garissa University College that left 148 people dead. Most of those killed were students. The workers have been targeted since the construction began. ALSO READ:
