The mother of three said when they arrived at the pastor’s “prayer room”, the pastor intervened explaining to them the need for every individual to be prayed for separately, for separate blessings, something that prompted each to enter the room alone. The alleged raped woman was the last to enter the room where the pastor was waiting only to come out and narrate to others how the pastor had raped her in pretext of “marching out” demons. The woman said when she entered the room, the pastor started caressing her before advancing his actions to rape.  She further said that when she asked the pastor of his deeds, he said he was in the process of squeezing out demons possessing her. The police report read, “After the session with the pastor, she moved out to narrate to others what she had gone through with an aim of establishing whether the rest of her family members had been subjected to the same style of “prayers”. Unfortunately, she was all alone, the rest had walked out safely. Hopelessly, they allegedly left the pastor’s home and proceeded to a clinic in Emali before reporting the alleged rape to Emali police station. ALSO READ:
