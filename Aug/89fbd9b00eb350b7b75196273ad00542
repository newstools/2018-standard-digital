The task force chairman, Barasa Nyukuri, said the audit was conducted across all the nine sub-counties. A total of 426 staff were interviewed. Mr Barasa, who is also a governance consultant, said the county administration needed to have in place proper measures to recover money lost through payment of salaries to ghost workers. ALSO READ:
