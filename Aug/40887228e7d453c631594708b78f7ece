The matatu driver and a female passenger died on the spot. There was a major traffic snarl-up that was worsened by overlapping drivers before traffic police moved in to contain the situation. According to a witness, Reverend John Wachira, a pedestrian who was knocked down was the main cause of the accident.  Wachira said that on hitting the pedestrian, the trailer driver panicked and swerved to the right hitting the Nissan matatu that was fully packed. “The pedestrian died on the spot after he was run-over by the trailer which later hit an oncoming matatu killing the two passengers,” he said. Another witness Wilson Wambugu said that the pedestrian was walking towards Naivasha town on the road when the accident occurred.  “The accident occurred too fast,” he said. At the scene, personal effects soaked in a pool of blood as police moved in to control the surging crowd and traffic. ALSO READ:
