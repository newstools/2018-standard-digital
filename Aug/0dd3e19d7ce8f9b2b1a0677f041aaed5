County employees have yet to be paid their July salaries. The assembly failed to pass the budget estimates before the June 30 deadline. Instead, the Sh6.3 billion budget was approved last week, a month after the stipulated deadline. The county has written to its workers, warning them of the delay. The county secretary, Hirum Kahiro, on Wednesday informed the employees that their July salaries would be paid later this month. “This is to inform you that we expect some delays in processing of the July 2018 salaries. This has been occasioned by challenges related to logistics of closure and opening of financial year,” read a memo to the staff.  The delay in passing the budget has been criticised by local leaders, among them Nyandarua County assembly speaker, Ndegwa Wahome, and Woman Representative Faith Gitau. Mr Wahome termed the delay as serious, saying the budget should have been tabled long ago. He said the delay was unfortunate since it would affect the operations of the county government. “The budget-making process has timelines, which the executive has failed to follow,” he said. Wahome observed that the Public Finance Management Act was silent on what should be done to an official who delayed the budget.
