Residents protest ranch auction plan The legislators’ call comes at a time when tonnes of products from quarries are being extracted at Jaribuni in Ganze Constituency for the ongoing construction of the LAPPSET project in Lamu County. Speaking during a youth conference at Pwani University on Saturday, Mr Baya said most investors in the area "export" material for processing outside the county, thus denying local residents job opportunities. Mwambire said the community will only benefit if the county comes up with a law to protect the resources. “Investors never involve leaders when they want to do their projects and that is why they have not set up a single factory that will benefit the people of Kilifi,” said Mwambire.
