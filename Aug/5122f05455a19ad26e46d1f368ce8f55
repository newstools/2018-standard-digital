Ghost of corruption back to haunt Zuma as probe begins Speaking when the dealers presented a Sh300,000 cheque to Governor Lee Kinyanjui in aid of the Solai dam tragedy victims, Ms Muchemi said the askaris targeted dealers of all products, including M-Pesa. "We don't understand why they are harassing us. We need a quick solution to this matter because we are likely to be pushed out of business if this continues," she said. Muchemi also said some counties were imposing multiple licences, which was negatively impacting businesses. "Despite paying the normal single-business permits and permits for signage, some counties are charging extra fees for graphics on M-Pesa shops. This is driving many dealers out of the market."
