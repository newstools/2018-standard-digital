The four MPs, Oscar Sudi (Kapseret), Sam Atandi (Alego Usonga), Dismas Barasa (Kimili) and Ayub Savula (Lugari) were having a drink when a South Sudanese national confronted them in his drunken stupor. "Just without provocation, he walked to the table where my colleagues Oscar, Atandi and Barasa were seated. When we protested he blew cigarette smoke on Atandi’s face,” said Mr Savula.
