 We are often told that drinking one or two glasses of wine a day can be good for us, but a new study suggests that this may not be the case. Researchers from the University of Washington have found that there is no safe level of drinking alcohol. Dr Emmanuela Gakidou, senior author of the study, said: “The health risks associated with alcohol are massive. “Our findings are consistent with other recent research, which found clear and convincing correlations between drinking and premature death, cancer, and cardiovascular problems. “Zero alcohol consumption minimises the overall risk of health loss." In the study, the researchers analysed data on alcohol-related deaths and health outcomes for 195 countries from 1990-2016. Know if news is factual and true.

This includes heart disease, cancers, liver-damage, diabetes, and alcohol-use disorders, as well as drowning, self-harm and transportation-related injuries. Max Griswold, who led the study, said: "With the largest collected evidence base to date, our study makes the relationship between health and alcohol clear - drinking causes substantial health loss, in myriad ways, all over the world.” The researchers hope their findings will help to inform policies and programs to do with alcohol. Dr Gakidou added: “There is a compelling and urgent need to overhaul policies to encourage either lowering people's levels of alcohol consumption or abstaining entirely. “The myth that one or two drinks a day are good for you is just that - a myth. This study shatters that myth."
