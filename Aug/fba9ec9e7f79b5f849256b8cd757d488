Maurice Ogendo, a boda boda rider at Lubao market, said they had earlier seen the woman holding her baby near Lubao Primary School. She appeared to be in deep thoughts. Mr Ogendo said after half an hour, the woman, known to them, had disappeared. They had all assumed she walked home. “Minutes later, we heard a baby crying and rushed to where the woman had been standing. She had abandoned the baby there. We called her grandmother and handed over the baby to her,” Ogendo said.  The rider said they pursued woman and found her trying to board a vehicle to Malava. “We took her to Kakamega Central Police station,” he said. Local suspected that the woman could have been impregnated by a relative and may have wanted to get rid of the baby.
