There have been allegations that patients have not been getting enough food and drugs and that there is congestion at the facility,” he said. He wondered why the hospital could not offer good services, yet it generated its revenue and got conditional grant from the national government by virtue of its level five status. “We will write to Director of Public Prosecutions asking him to order an audit of the hospital’s financial management.
