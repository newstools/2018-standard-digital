Three killed in grisly road accident In the hit and run incident near the Gilgil Weighbridge, the body was left lying in the middle of road adversely affecting the flow of vehicles. The situation was worsened by overlapping motorists before traffic police from the nearby Gilgil Police Station moved in and collected the body. It was not clear where the woman was headed to as she had no identification on her. A driver Samuel Waithaka said that they found the body of the woman who was bleeding from the head lying in the middle of the road.  He said that motorists had to use one side of the road leading to the jam that at one time stretched for over 2kms on both ends of the scene. “It took police time to access the scene and carry away the body before the flow of traffic could resume an hour later,” he said. Gilgil OCPD Emmanuel Opuru confirmed the incident saying that body had since been collected and taken to the area mortuary awaiting identification. “There was a hit and run incident on Thursday night along the Nairobi-Nakuru highway and the victim does not have any identification documents,” he said.

Opuru expressed his confidence that it was a matter of time before they arrested the father of two who is on the run. “Our officers are working round the clock to arrest the suspect who is a well-known trader in Kikopey Gilgil,” he said. On Sunday, the 30-year-old suspect stabbed the 25-year-old wife twice before locking her in the house leaving her to bleed to death. The body was located by the deceased sister two days later before police moved and collected it before launching a manhunt for the fleeing suspect.
