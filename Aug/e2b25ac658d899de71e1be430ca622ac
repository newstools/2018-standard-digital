Investors in the Sh1.3 billion bond issued by struggling small and medium enterprise lender Real People have given the firm five more months to pay up. In a notice yesterday, Real People said it had met the investors to renegotiate the terms for the bond that matured on Monday and they had agreed to wait for payments until January. The firm will, however, be required to pay interest on the loans so as not to completely default. “The note holders... resolved that the maturity date for the 13.65 fixed rate note be extended from August 6, 2018 to January 6, 2019,” said the firm in a notice published in the dailies. The lender had announced that it was insolvent and headed for default on its three-year Sh267 million medium-term note that matured on Monday while its ability to meet payments for the five-year Sh1.036 note, which matures in 2020, was also called into question. New capital Real People offered the bond holders an equity stake in the company to ensure the business stayed afloat even as it sought other options to inject new capital.
