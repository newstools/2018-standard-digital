Speaking at the Word of Faith Church in Homa Bay Town on Friday, during this year’s evangelical international conference with theme ‘leadership and integrity’, Kambona challenged Sifuna to stop making comments which impede the fight against corruption. “Corruption is a serious menace which should be fought by everybody in this country. We are telling our political leaders to stop defending leaders who are arrested over suspicion on corruption,” said Kambona. He argued that offices of the Director of Public Prosecutions, Directorate of Criminal Investigations and the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission should be given time to arrest leaders accused of corruption. “All corruption suspects should be taken to court where they are given opportunity to defend themselves. Anybody found culpable should carry their own cross without intervention of a politician,” Kambona added. Know if news is factual and true.
