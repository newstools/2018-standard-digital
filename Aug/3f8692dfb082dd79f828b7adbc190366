MP wants colleagues probed on sugar brief “I do not know of anybody who was bribed. Nobody should involve me in witch-hunting,” said Mr Mbadi. The Suba South MP accused the joint Committee on Trade and Agriculture of undertaking shoddy investigations to protect the sugar barons involved in the scam. He argued that the report was weak and could not be adopted by Parliament. Speaking during a fundraiser at Ongoro Lutheran Church in Kabondo Kasipul constituency, Mbadi said the report failed to include findings on the level of contamination of the sugar and the people who imported it.  “We expected to know whether the sugar contained mercury or not. If yes, the report should have told us who imported the sugar,” he added. On Sunday, Kieni MP Kanini Kega, the chairman of the joint committee, said Mbadi and Majority Leader Aden Duale should be blamed for the rejection of the report.  ALSO READ:
