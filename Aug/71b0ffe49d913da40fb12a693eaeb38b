Following that, a document showing the agreement between two individuals concerning the storage of the laptops has emerged. In the document, Teddy Awiti, a 34-year old man identified as the owner of the consignment signed an agreement with businessman Allan Chesang to store laptops at the latter’s house at a fee.  It stipulates that 1247 pieces of HP laptops would be stored at House No. 220 Kyuna Rise for monthly fee of Sh60,000 plus VAT. As per the document, the two agreed to shoulder their tax obligations independently. Awiti would also provide protection to Chesang in case of anything given that the latter only leased a storage space. The police vowed to dig deeper into the incident to bring all the suspects to book.
