The officers have been taking us round in circles ever since,” said Wairimu. She added that the officers later called and informed her that Lelekong had been moved to CID headquarters in Nairobi. Ms Wairimu said she tried to reach Lelekong on Thursday morning, but the call was picked by CID officers, who told her he was asleep. The mobile phone was later switched off.
