The issue was detected by banks, which noticed he was transferring CDF money to the family companies. EACC spokesman Yassin Aila said investigations had shown the MP used family companies that he registered to do businesses. “The businesses included construction works in the constituency.

He told the officials he was helping youths who could not raise the needed portfolio get the business and be paid. He was picked and taken to Integrity Centre for processing ahead of his arraignment on Thursday. His arrest comes in the wake of sustained war on corruption, which many see as a major threat to development. Other pundits say tribalism is a major issue affecting development at large. President Kenyatta met the commission at the weekend and told them they have his full support and urged them to step up the fight against corruption. The president advised the EACC to work closely with other agencies in the fight against the vice, saying the war against graft should not be a source of competition within Government. ALSO READ:
