The letter further states that the decision to summarily dismiss Tarus was based on an interdiction letter dated March 15, 2018; his response and appearance before the board on July 31, 2018 and findings of an investigation. It gave him a chance to appeal to the public service commission within 90 days in the event that he was dissatisfied with the decision. Speaking to The Standard on phone, the board’s secretary said the dismissal was a private matter.  The dismissal has elicited mixed reactions with some saying it was unjust. One resident, Meshack Kiplagat, described it as “the most unjust sacking in the history of the government”. “The public service board should put on a human face and allow the young man a chance to refund the Sh800 instead of sacking him. Mistakes do happen when we handle money and sacking him is brutal,” posted Kiplagat on the social media. Others supported the dismissal saying all employees had to be accountable. ALSO READ:
