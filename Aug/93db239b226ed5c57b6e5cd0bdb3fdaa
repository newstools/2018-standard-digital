Kisumu County has launched an ambitious Sh17 billion master plan to bring water to at least 200 metres from every one of its 1.2 million residents in the next two years. The county, whose own initiative is a Sh5.2 billion expansion plan, has roped in Kisumu Town Water and Sewerage Company (Kiwasco) and Lake Victoria South Water Services Board (LVSWB), which will invest Sh11.8 billion to improve water and sanitation in the county.

Residents protest over inflated water bills In the ambitious three-prong plan, more water will be extracted from Lake Victoria and Kibos River, rain water harvested, boreholes sunk and water piped from neighbouring counties to step up supply to 100 per cent coverage from the current 78. Kiwasco is expected to boost extraction at the Dunga Beach point from the current 21,000 cubic metres to 45,000. LVSWB will invest in a new treatment plant with a capacity of 36,000 cubic metres per hour. The joint effort will see more than 200 community water projects initiated and completed in the next two years. LVSWB plans to sink at least five boreholes from where water will be pumped using solar energy to raised large tanks and supplied via gravity. Avoid fake news!
