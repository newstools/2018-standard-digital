But the plaintiff now argues that they both mysteriously went missing two days later and to date they cannot be traced. The court heard that while Walutsachi was looking for money by updating his NHIF card he was not aware that his wife and child had being discharged. The hospital produced to him the discharge forms of the wife and birth notification of the new baby.
The man later went to the police and lodged a missing person report. He argues that the hospital failed to keep proper records of its patients and had employed unqualified staff.
