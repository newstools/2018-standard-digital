Ms Njoki was suspended for two months after she allegedly assaulted Chief Whip Simon Wamwea during a Liaison Committee retreat after they differed over a plot to remove the position of deputy speaker. The motion divided the house, with some members describing the deliberations as uncalled for as they were personal and driven by malice. Defending herself, Wanjiku claimed Kamande’s allegations were driven by malice having declined his sexual advances. She said that after turning him down, he vowed to punish her through all means. Members Amos Murigi (Kimorori) and Stanley Muhia (Makuyu) defended Wanjiku saying she should be pardoned as differences between him and Kamande were personal.
