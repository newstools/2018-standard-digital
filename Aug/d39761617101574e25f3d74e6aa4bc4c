It felt like two metres to the left, then two metres to the right, I could not stand up,” said Gino Poggiali, a 43-year-old Frenchman, who was with his wife and two children, at the Lombok airport. His wife Maude, 44, said the family were on Bali for the first quake and Lombok for the second. “This is it for me in Indonesia,” she said. “Next time we will stay in France or somewhere close.” Carlos Romartinez, a 24-year-old Spaniard who was also waiting for a flight out of Lombok, said he had decided to head instead to the island of Flores to the east. “All the activities are shut down. We can’t dive, we can’t do anything so we will go to another island,” he said. ALSO READ:

Some of them said their own houses had been destroyed but they were still helping us.” About 1,000 foreign and domestic tourists were evacuated in boats from the three Gili islands off the northwest coast of Lombok, BNPB spokesman Nugroho said via Twitter. No tourists died on the Gilis, he said. Singapore Law and Home Affairs Minister K.

Came out, and made my way down a staircase, while building was still shaking. Power went out for a while. Lots of cracks, fallen doors,” he wrote on Facebook. His government issued a travel notice on Monday, advising citizens to defer travel to Lombok and urging those currently there to leave. Australia’s Minister for Home Affairs Peter Dutton was on the 12th floor of a Lombok hotel when the quake struck. “We were knocked certainly to the floor,” he told Australian radio. “We were pretty lucky to get out. Everyone’s a bit shaken but all well.”  ALSO READ:
