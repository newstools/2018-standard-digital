The ODM MCAs, who were led by Deputy Speaker Evance Marieba, Dan Were (Kakelo Kokowanyo), Julius Gaya (Central Karachuonyo) and Juma Awuor (Homa Bay Town East), among others, accused Mr Ogindo of demonstrating poor leadership and disrespecting elected leaders in the county. “We have lacked unity in discharging our oversight role because of Ogindo’s leadership. We have decided to oust him from the position so that Muok takes over,” said Were. But Ogindo dismissed the ouster and insisted he and his deputy were still in office. He further criticised the impeachment process as unprocedural and unacceptable. “I am still the majority leader and I am not aware of any ouster. My colleagues followed an undue process,” said Ogindo. Avoid becoming a victim of Fake News. Subscribe to the Standard Group SMS service by texting 'NEWS' to 22840. He added: “The disrespect comes about because I stood up against some elected leaders from this county. I cannot allow anybody to dictate to me my roles simply because he is an elected leader." Mr Marieba said they would serve assembly Speaker Elizabeth Ayoo with official notification that Ogindo had been kicked out. “We needed a simple majority of the 58 MCAs but we have got 31. We are going to serve the ODM party with the notification after notifying the speaker,” said Marieba. ALSO READ:
