The firm represented Baringo County in a petition filed by the Turkana County government and Turkana professionals over the boundary dispute in 2015. The petition was heard by judges George Odunga, Weldon Korir and Isaac Lenaola.

After the petition was determined, the deputy registrar directed the county to pay KTK Advocates Sh17.5 million. However, through lawyer Gordon Ogolla, the county accused the deputy registrar of ignoring their submissions and awarding exorbitant legal fees. They argued that the deputy registrar was openly biased and failed to excise her discretion judiciously in arriving at the instruction fees. However, Justice John Mativo dismissed the submissions by the county and noted that the county was given time to file its submission on several instances. “That judgement be and is hereby entered in favour of the applicant herein, KTK Advocates, against the respondent, Baringo County government, in the sum of Sh17,570,907.08 plus interest at court rates from the date of taxation,” he ruled.
