African Parliamentarians' Network Against Corruption(APNAC) 2018 President Justice Muturi during the APNAC 2018 Inaugural Board meeting at Parliament on Friday 27/07/18. [Boniface Okendo,Standard] In 2015, none other than National Assembly Speaker Justin Muturi invited the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission to investigate MPs. At the time, it had been claimed that MPs were not only making false mileage claims, they were drawing sitting allowances even when they had not attended meetings. ALSO READ:

MPs, committees ashaming Parliament Indeed, Mr. Muturi expressed concerns that some former Members of Parliament continued to draw salaries from the Parliamentary Service Commission. The same year, a Member of Parliament who sat on one of the parliamentary committees admitted that members often received inducements. Shockingly, in 2015, members of the powerful Public Accounts Committee accused their chairman of corruption, refusal to delegate duties, and more often than not, going on unnecessary foreign trips.For Muturi to have gone ahead and summoned journalist who recently brought to public limelight the corrupt practices within parliament for questioning is to go back on oneâ€™s own words and to negate efforts to fight corruption. Granted, the journalists who were summoned are accredited to report from Parliament and must follow a set of rules, but that should not detract them from reporting factually on what they observe. There have been several attempts to intimidate the media, but that will not stop journalists from exercising their right and freedom to inform. Journalists will not succumb to intimidation from whatever quarters in the discharge of their duties. Know if news is factual and true. Text 'NEWS' to 22840 and always receive verified news updates. The media is the last bastion of truth and justice in a world where corruption and all that is bad reign supreme. It must be allowed to play that role unencumbered.
