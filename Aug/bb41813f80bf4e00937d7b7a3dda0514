It is for that reason that to get access to a majority of buildings and other establishments, one is searched. What if one day you arrive at the airport and there are no car checks, sniffer dogs, system scanners and rigorous personnel search? You might be alarmed and question our own security. Video management The age of big data is here. We are witnessing volume, velocity and variety of data in this era. The security industry is aware of the risks that come with this era. However, we are also extracting meaning from that extraordinary amount of data that could in turn lower crime, reduce road carnage, save energy, and the list goes on. Avoid fake news!

Intelligent video management software provides a near instant forensic search of recorded video using criteria such as colour or size and face recognition capability that allows one to upload a picture of a person of interest. Hence this system will investigate and filter recorded video by similarities such as size, colour, direction, speed of object motion, and more. It also has the ability to capture license plates and access automated number plate recognition of both full and partial number plates and an interactive 3D map with a visual overview of all installed cameras on a site map.

Notably, technology is not intended to replace the human factor; it supplements human efforts to reduce the element of risk in any assignment. As the Government and private sector players work together to offer protection to the citizenry and their property, the use of modern technology needs to be at the centre of it.
