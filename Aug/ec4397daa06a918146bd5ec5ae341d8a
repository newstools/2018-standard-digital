"The programme will help farmers increase their earnings. It is regrettable that farmers have not been able to optimise production due to poor breeds, but this is now set to be a thing of the past," said the county executive for livestock and pastoral economy, Geoffrey Lipale. He added: "Our farmers only produce up to 18 litres of milk per cow when our neighbours in Trans Nzoia produce up to 28 litres. That is why we are devising ways to improve our production.”  The county produces 40,000 to 45,000 litres of milk in a day. The county government is expected to spend Sh3 million on the programme that will target all the 20 wards. Mr Lipale said the efforts were also aimed at ending nomadic pastoralism in the region.
