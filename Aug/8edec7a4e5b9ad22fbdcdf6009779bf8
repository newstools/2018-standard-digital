Police officer killed, two injured in Al-Shaabab attack The two officers are jointly charged with the murder of Janet Wangui Waiyaki on May 20, 2018 at City Park. They denied the charges on June 11, 2018. Wednesday morning, Lady Justice Stella Mutuku said the prosecution failed to table enough evidence in court to prove that the two will abscond bail when released on conditions. “The apprehension by the prosecution that the accused will interfere with the witnesses or abscond bail in not backed by persuasive evidence to lead me to finding that there are compelling reasons against granting of this application,” said Mutuku. She ruled that she was appreciative that the rights of the victims must be taken into account by ensuring that the accused persons face trial over the allegations so that the trial court will determine whether they are guilty or not and make appropriate orders to ensure justice is done.  “I will allow the application by the defence to have the two officers released on bond but with conditions,” said Mutuku. Their lawyer said the prosecution did not table any authorities or any evidence showing how the accused will interfere with the witnesses when released on bail. “My clients have been brought to this court not as police officers but as accused persons,” said Langat. He said the constitution says that every accused person has a right to be released on bail unless there are compelling reasons as to why they should be denied bail. ALSO READ:
