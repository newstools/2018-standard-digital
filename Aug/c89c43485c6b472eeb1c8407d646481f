Six suspects masquerading as IEBC officials arrested “The officers are the first suspects who should tell us where they were when the incident occurred. I have submitted my file to the DPP for advice,” said Mr Wachira. The break-in occurred in Government offices in the same compound as those of County Commissioner Irungu Macharia. Criminals broke into the offices in Homa Bay town and stole eight desktop computers and a laptop. Some offices had their door locks broken. Some workers said the theft could have been an inside job, since some doors were opened with keys. An officer from the Department of Persons Living with Disability told journalists they lost important data "about the disabled persons from Homa Bay" and that it would take time to recover the information”. The offices at the National Government headquarters are under 24-hour surveillance by police officers. Stay informed while on the go by subscribing to the Standard Group SMS service.
