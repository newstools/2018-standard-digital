The rift between Members of the County Assembly and Governor Wilber Ottichilo (pictured) appears to be widening after the MCAs asked him to take charge of the county. Reading a joint resolve of the House yesterday, Deputy Speaker Nixon Butiya said Dr Ottichilo was undermining the authority and mandate despite them having done everything to facilitate smooth operations of the county executive.

He was given express mandate by voters to be the county boss. He should not delegate such a critical mandate to wheeler-dealers.

In April we went for bonding in Nairobi but since we came back, they have taken a different route. They want to implement, yet their work is oversight. They want to micromanage the executive, which is unprocedural,” Ottichilo said.
