He also argued that the court expanded the scope of the petition, thus condemning him on matters he did not have an opportunity to respond to. “The judges erred in law by disregarding the scrutiny report prepared by the Deputy Registrar (SK Arome DR) on November 23, 2017,” said Waibara.

Wanjiku was declared the winner with 39,447 votes on August 10, 2017, while Waibara was second with 9,314 votes.
