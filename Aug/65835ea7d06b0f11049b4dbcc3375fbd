Most public hospitals have been hit by an acute shortage of children's syrup. Parents are forced to buy the syrups, including painkillers, antibiotics and multivitamins, from chemists. ALSO READ:

Recall of cancer causing drugs will not affect supply, says Ministry The shortage has affected services for the past month. "Dispensaries have been hit hard by the shortage. There is no medicine for children. We refer parents to chemists," a nurse at one of the facilities said on Monday. The facilities lack lotions for various skin conditions such as eczema, scabies and dermatitis in babies. The hospitals are also facing shortage of essential antibiotics, including Septrin. They lack drugs used to treat sexually transmitted diseases. Patients cannot be treated for wounds, chest infections and anthrax as a result of the same shortage. The hospitals also lack contraceptives.  County director of health services Solomon Sirma blamed the shortage on failure by the Kenya Medical Supplies Authority to supply the drugs on time. On Monday, Dr Sirma said the drugs were finally delivered on Saturday but not distributed as the officer in charge of the store was not available.  ALSO READ:
