At least 4,700 workers are expected to boycott duty from August 6 after the Government failed to pay their allowances as recommended by the Salaries and Remuneration Commission in March 2015.

He added: “Patients are not like any other customers. They need care. But we also need our money which was to be paid in 201.” The allowances were to be paid in two phases of 60 and 40 per cent.  KNH management told the mediator appointed by Ministry of Labour that it was still looking for funds to pay the health workers' allowances amounting to Sh339.8 million. This was in additional Sh1.09 million for the first and second phase respectively. The first phase was to be effected from January 2017 while the second from July 2017.
