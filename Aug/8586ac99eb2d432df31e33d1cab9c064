Doubts on efficacy and safety of polio vaccine Children under the age of five are receiving the vaccine orally.

The issue of fever can only occur if it was being administered directly into the blood,” said Dr Mahugu.

In April, when the Government started a vigorous polio immunisation campaign, some parents claimed that the vaccine was making their children ill. Some of them do not want their children to be vaccinated during the ongoing campaign. The Government plans to carry out three rounds of vaccination. The latest was unveiled during the weekend in Kitui County. The door-to-door campaign is targeting 2.8 million children. The vaccination started after the polio type two virus was found in sewage in Kamkunji, Nairobi, on March 21, just as Kenya was getting ready to be declared polio-free. The third round of immunisation will take place in a month’s time. ALSO READ:
