The price Kenyans will pay for Uhuru's Big Four agenda Mr Atwoli said the region had not been able to produce a president since independence because those who tried to win the top seat had no financial muscle. The trade unionist was speaking at Emusire High School on Saturday, during the homecoming ceremony for Emuhaya MP Omboko Milemba. Atwoli claimed he had already saved Sh500 million to fund a presidential candidate from the region and called on area politicians and businessmen to contribute more. “Musalia Mudavadi, Moses Wetang’ula and Wycliffe Oparanya have all declared their interest in the top seat. We will decide among the three and any other person who shows an interest in the seat and support them to the last man, but we need Sh10 billion for the campaign,” he said.  He said the region would soon decide who was the best man to vie for the presidency. “All candidates from western Kenya eyeing the presidency will undergo vigorous vetting. We will conduct an opinion poll to get the most popular candidate and even subject them to nominations.” In the last opinion poll last year, Mr Mudavadi was declared the Luhya spokesperson.
