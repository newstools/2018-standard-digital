What next for Awiti after painful court verdict As he recuperated from eye surgery last month, the Court of Appeal upheld a High Court verdict that had annulled his election. His lawyers have appealed the decision in the Supreme Court. Mr Awiti, known to his supporters as Akuba (the big man), said he had recovered. “I was not out office because of the court ruling. I underwent an eye surgery but I am now well and ready to serve the people,” he explained. The governor said he did not go to the Supreme Court because he feared losing in a by-election.
