According to KMA's acting Director General George Macgoye, a search is still on for the metal cylinder that can cause serious damage to vessels if they accidentally hit it. "On the evening of August 10, it detached from the piles that are used to hook it into position and started floating between Mtangawanda and Lamu Port," said Mr Macgoye. The agency has issued an alert to the public and seafarers in the area to be on the lookout for the floating gear, especially those operating between Lamu main island and the smaller adjoining islands.  "We are also asking the public to notify our offices immediately it is sighted. We further urge those operating vessels in the area or transiting the waters closer to Lamu island to be wary of dangers posed by the detached pontoon," said Macgoye. The search is being conducted jointly by a Lamu Port contractor, Kenya Ports Authority (KPA), Marine Police and the Rapid Border Patrol Uniit (RBPU). "We will advise further on the success of the search efforts and subsequent retrieval of the pontoon," said KMA in a statement. Fishermen in the area fear the pontoon might have collided with a vessel and sunk, or washed up in mangrove forests. ALSO READ:
