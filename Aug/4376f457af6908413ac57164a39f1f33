Four suspects who were on Friday arrested for allegedly stealing Sh72.6 million from the Kenya Commercial Bank will today be arraigned in court to face charges. The four who are KCB employees include Benson Mwai Karugu, Edmund Kirturi Mutua, Evans Kenda Kiplagat and Macdonald Mochama Mongwe. Communication from the Directorate of Criminal Investigations dictates that they transferred money in small amounts to accounts based with various banks in Nairobi, Mombasa, Eldoret and Malindi. An investigation by the DCI also revealed that some 37 companies were registered with KCB to facilitate the fraud through fake point of sale card transaction claims which were approved by the four suspects. This comes in the wake of escalating theft in corporations which authorities have identifed as an ‘inside job’, hence raising concerns into the efficiency of security in public institutions. The Director of Criminal Investigation George Kinoti has also warned banks, regulators and mobile service providers to carry out proper internal investigations before engaging law enforcers.
