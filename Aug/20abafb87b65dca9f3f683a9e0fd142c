NAIROBI, KENYA: Tanzanian Authorities have banned carrots from Kenya in a move that is likely to affect local farmers and escalate trade war between the two East African nations Local reports indicate that the ban was issued last week by the incoming Arumeru District Commissioner Jerry Muro saying the move is to protect Tanzanian farmers from competition. According to a local daily, the commissioner said he will personally inspect Lorries on the Arusha-Moshi HighwayÂ to ensure the commodity is not sneaked in Tanzania The move is likely to put into question a raft of measures signed in July between the two countries to free up trade space. Among trade issues that Principal Secretary Trade Chris Kiptoo and his Tanzanian counterpart Elisante Ole Gabriel agreed on include the immediate implementation of the report that was conducted by Kenya bureau of standards and Tanzania Food and Drugs Authority for a week in March. The two agreed to work on the electronic tracking of Tanzania's cargo at the Namanga border, and will both visit the border.
