The ongoing demolition of buildings in and around riparian land is a commendable attempt at restoring the sanity of a country that was fast losing her soul. The nobility of the exercise should not in any way be cushioned by frivolous court orders by those in the wrong. The courts should also not entertain moves by the corrupt to sanctify their names within the corridors of power. We are at a turning point as a country. And what we do now may define the path of our country for years to come.

We have a chance to rise from the ashes like the proverbial phoenix, let us rise to the occasion and make things right, if not for us, for our childrenâ€™s children. The disorder has been part of us for far too long, it is time we cut it off and look towards a fresh start. ALSO READ:
