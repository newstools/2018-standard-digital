However, they failed to convince the judge to lift their suspension from participating in the market. Mr Ahmed was slapped with a Sh5 million fine and kicked out of the market for three years while Mr Alubala was fined Sh104.8 million and disqualified for 10 years.

Ahmed was accused of approving questionable invoices of up to Sh5 million, misleading the board over disposal of assets and loan reclassification that hid bad loans, thus misleading the public on the state of the bank. Alubala was one of the directors punished for their role in the deposit-mobilising consultancies scam that cost the State lender Sh1 billion.
