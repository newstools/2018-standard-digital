  Eight more suspects in the Sh5.6 billion maize scandal were Friday charged before a magistrate's court in Milimani. Among the eight was National Cereals and Produce Board (NCPB) Eldoret branch manager Renson Korir, who faced three counts of abuse of office, neglect of duty and failing to ensure prudent use of funds. Mr Korir allegedly failed to ensure that NCPB bought enough maize for the Strategic Grain Reserve (SGR) and ensuring that the money allocated for purchase of white maize was prudently used.
