Some 414 gas cylinders and 48,000 litres of gas were impounded in Karatina town. A multi-agency task force led by Assistant Inspector General John Gachomo, representing the Directorate of Criminal Investigations, raided an LPG filling facility in a residential area. A lorry was parked outside the facility waiting to offload the gas. “This facility has no licences for filling LPG gas. This is a danger to those who live near this facility and also those who have bought the gas."
