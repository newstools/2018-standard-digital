Construction of Sh20 billion Koru-Soin dam is now set to start after Kisumu County Government opened negotiations for its implementation. County Executive for Water Salmon Orimba on Friday said works would begin in the next two months. The project at the border of Kisumu and Kericho counties was mooted by the national government in 1992 but has delayed to commence following what Orimba termed as misunderstanding between implementers and would-be beneficiaries. Compensation for villagers to be displaced by the dam will cost the Government Sh2 billion. Although feasibility studies and designs had been completed, works on the project were abandoned in 2006 when valuation of the land to be acquired for the project met resistance from owners ahead of compensations. But on Friday, Orimba said the county government has since reached out to the relevant authorities and was on the final stretch of reactivating the project.  “Last week, we met officials of the National Water Conservation and Pipeline Corporation and we have agreed to restart the project. We have also met members of the communities to be affected by the project and we can see some positive response,” said Orimba. According to the official, residents of both Kisumu and Kericho were to be affected by the project. Orimba said the project was aimed at controlling floods in the lower parts of Nyando, as well as providing water for domestic and irrigation for the two counties. Out of the 93 million cubic metres of water to be held by the dam, 53,000 would be treatment and supplied to reservoirs in Koru, Muhoroni, Awasi, Chemelil, Ahero, Miwani, Rabuor, Mamboleo and Riat for domestic use. The project is part of agenda captured in the manifesto of Governor Anyang’ Nyong’o aimed at ending water scarcity in the county.
