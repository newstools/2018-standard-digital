Amani National Congress leader Musalia Mudavadi has dismissed claims he will join the government. Mudavadi said the handshake deal between President Uhuru Kenyatta and Raila Odinga was not in good faith. “We cannot have a dialogue that involves two people only. We want an inclusive dialogue where all stakeholders are involved,’’ he said at Emusire High School during the homecoming of Emuhaya MP Omboko Milemba. ALSO READ:

To rally the public, keep politics out of graft purge According to Mudavadi, all parties cannot be in government since it will open doors for corruption. “Jubilee has already formed a government and has numbers to conduct business. I cannot be a cabinet secretary the way some people are proposing,” said Mudavadi. He further said he will be in the ballot in 2022 and that he will not sacrifice his ambition in favour of anybody. “Time is ripe for me to lead the country and nothing will stop me from becoming the next President. I am calling for support from my brothers in the opposition to back me to succeed President Uhuru Kenyatta.” But Kakamega Governor Wycliffe Oparanya urged him to instead support his presidential bid. COTU Secretary General Francis Atwoli claimed we would have a referendum to change the Constitution before the elections. But Mudavadi dismissed the matter, saying IEBC had not been reformed as proposed.  Vihiga Governor Wilbur Ottichilo, however, welcomed calls for a referendum but added the current IEBC commissioners should not preside over the exercise. “We lost trust in the electoral body after it bungled the August General Election and we cannot go to the referendum with the same commissioners overseeing the exercise,” Dr Ottichilo said.
