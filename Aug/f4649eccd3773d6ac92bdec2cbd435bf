Revealed: Inside the dark world of tender cartels Appearing before the Powers and Privileges Committee, chaired by Mr Muturi, acting Managing Editor Ken Bosire and writers Antony Mwangi and Dinah Ondari requested for more time. But Mr Bosire stressed news sources are sacred and that they will not be disclosed. “We have requested for more time to adequately prepare. We will come back on Tuesday 14. The 10 days will give us sufficient time to respond to the matter raised,” said Bosire, after appearing before the committee. The meeting room was shifted to the Speaker’s office and it was a closed-door sitting, locking out a battery of journalists who had camped at Parliament Buildings in solidarity with their colleagues.  “The committee has confirmed the journalists will not be grilled but asked to provide information to help them further their investigations. We have asked the committee to deal with the editor and not individual journalists,” added Bosire. The media house honoured the invite by House clerk Michael Siala even as Kenyans bashed MPs for going after the journalists for ‘exposing’ corruption among members of committees.
