Two police officers killed in shooting “It has become an uphill task to get sugar since the controversy over imports began. Don’t be surprised to buy the same at a higher price next time you come looking for sugar,” a worker at the Yako Wholesalers Kakamega town said. A 50kg bag of Kabras sugar is retailing at Sh6,000 up from Sh5,000 at Yako Wholesalers and several retail shops in the region. Last week, there was no sugar on the shelves of most supermarkets in Kakamega town. Yesterday, only the Kabras brand could be found in several shops, with 2kg selling at Sh300.

The federation wants the Sugar Pricing Committee to review the price of cane from the current Sh4,200 to at least Sh6,000 a tonne. ALSO READ:
