KISUMU, KENYA: Kisumu's largest referral hospital has opened investigations against one of its top surgeons accused of soliciting cash to save the life of a four-year old girl who was defiled a year ago. Jaramogi Oginga Odinga Teaching and Referral Hospital Chief Executive Officer Peter Okoth said administrative disciplinary procedures had been initiated against the doctor who allegedly demanded Sh150, 000 from the family to conduct a corrective surgery on the minor who is battling fistula.

Dr Okoth said similar allegations had been made against the doctor but bureaucracies in disciplining public servants had earned him time at the facility. “It was very unfortunate what happened and we have since taken disciplinary measures; he is no longer with us,” said Peter Okoth, the newly installed Chief Executive Officer. He clarified that the hospital does not charge for patients in such cases and described ordeal as “unfortunate and lacking in human emotion.” Know if news is factual and true.

The hospital, he said, had made administrative arrangements to have another pediatric surgeon who “was away for training in China and is currently honing skills at the Moi Referral Hospital brought to complete the treatment. The girl was defiled by a 15-year old neighbor who lured her with potato chips to a secluded site about 800 metres from their home on September 10 last year. Her weakened groans for help caught the attention of a woman passing by at a round 7pm.  “The woman who found her lying in a secluded thatch said she at first thought it was a cat,” recounted her mother.
