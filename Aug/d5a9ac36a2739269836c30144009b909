Litswa was charged with causing death by dangerous driving and an alternative charge of failing to report the fatal accident which claimed a life, within the stipulated time. On the second count, Mr Litswa who was denied a fine in the first offence, was given a Sh2,000 fine or 14 days imprisonment.

Litswa fled after the offense and was arrested three days later when a witness spotted the vehicle and informed the police who arrested him on August 12. The postmortem results of the officer showed that he died instantly as a result of multiple injuries. In his mitigation, Litswa told court that he was remorseful and had never committed another offense before. He begged the court to consider his position as the breadwinner of his family. “I have taken into consideration the mitigation by the accused that he is a first time offender. I therefore sentence him to three years imprisonment in count one and a fine of Sh2000 or 14 days in custody in the second count. Both sentences are to run concurrently,” said Resident Magistrate William Lopokoiyot when delivering the sentence. ALSO READ:
