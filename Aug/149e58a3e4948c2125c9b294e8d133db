The mortuary, which serves Nyanza and parts of western Kenya, at times receives up to 100 bodies in a month. Most of the bodies, Dr Okoth explained, were from accidents, murders and suicides. “The new mortuary will operate 24 hours," Okoth said. “We will have technologies for postmortem, a full range of organised, stand-alone and bench top pathology workstations,” Okoth said. The hospital, which has four mortuary technicians, will hire another one once the new mortuary is built.
