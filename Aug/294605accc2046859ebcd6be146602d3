Man sentenced to 20 years for killing city lawyer In the 3am incident at Kagumoini village in Kandara, the man is said to have tossed his nine-month-old child in the air, in a fit of rage, after he was told there was no food. The baby is reported to have died after landing on the floor. Lynch attempt The woman's cry awoke neighbours, who attempted to lynch the man. Local administrators rescued him.  The suspect was taken to Gaichanjiru Police Post and later to Kandara Police Station. Elias Kamau, a village elder, said he called police when he learnt about the incident. "It is a shame for a man to kill his own child following a quarrel with his wife that could have been avoided. There are other better ways to resolve domestic disputes, instead of targeting the children," he said. Kandara DCIO Peter Mugwika said investigation was on. ALSO READ:
