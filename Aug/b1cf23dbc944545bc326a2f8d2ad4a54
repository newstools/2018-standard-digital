Police net ivory worth Sh48m, arrests suspects “Mr Jirongo was ordered by this court to pay Mr Yongo Sh25 million in October 2015 but the sum remains unpaid. This is therefore to direct the police to arrest and present him to court unless he deposits the owed amount,” read the warrant of arrest. According to the notice, Mr Jirongo has paid only Sh5 million of the Sh25 million he owes Yongo. The court further ordered the former legislator to cater for the expenses and fees incurred by police officers sent to effect the warrant of arrest. Yongo submitted that he loaned Jirongo the cash between 2014 and 2015 but he failed to repay, prompting him to file the case in court. Avoid fake news!
