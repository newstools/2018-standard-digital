Representatives of farmers from Nandi, Kisumu and Kericho sugar growing zones yesterday submitted to the Ministry of Agriculture a list of amendments they want made to the document, which had been lying in draft form since 2001.

The appeal was signed by representatives of Muhoroni Multipurpose and Kisumu Sugarbelt Co-operative unions, Atyang’ Atiang and Tedman Kobilla. The farmers say creation of command sugar zones, which binds both contracted and private farmers in a specific area to specific millers, is not in line with a liberalised economy.

Infringe on rights “We are strongly against these clauses since they will infringe on the rights of sugarcane farmers to enjoy freedom of developing, marinating and harvesting their cane to the miller of their choice without being censored, since nearly 90 per cent of them are private farmers,” read the petition. Citing a Kakamega High Court ruling which outlawed restriction of a miller from another’s zone, the farmers want the introduction of milling zones lifted to allow new entrants into the industry.
