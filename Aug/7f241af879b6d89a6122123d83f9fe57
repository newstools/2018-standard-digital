Accused disown bag with heroin Mboga is reported to prey on young men and women desperate for employment, targeting them for recruitment on behalf of Nigerian drug cartels based in Kenya, Nigeria, India, Tanzania and Ethiopia. She established her Nigerian connection when she worked for Antony Chinedu before he was deported in 2013. According to police, she thereafter gained courage and established her own network distributing heroin in the domestic market and sending couriers to collect cocaine from Addis Ababa destined for the Asian, Arab and European markets like India, Thailand, Dubai and Netherlands. One of her couriers, Wycliffe Were was arrested on August 17, 2018 in New Delhi having ingested drug pellets.  Mboga has so far managed to send over 20 drug mules in 2017 and 2018 alone to the aforementioned destinations, some of whom have been arrested. Investigators involved in the operation intend to consolidate the cases in a bid to secure a successful prosecution of the subject. She was taken to custody ahead of her arraignment. Police have intensified operations against drug and human trafficking in the region, arresting dozens of suspects. ALSO READ:
