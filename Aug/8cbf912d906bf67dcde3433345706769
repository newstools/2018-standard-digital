They will get the amount they are entitled to," he said on Thursday. However, this did not happen. Wanjohi did not disclose the amount each officer was entitled to. However, Mureithi said they had budgeted for about 300 officers. He said the list of officers presented for payment was more than they expected, and they were still figuring out how to accommodate the extra number. An officer who has seen the list said it had increased to 720. This was confirmed by Mureithi, who said they had requested the Interior ministry for 300 officers only. "However, the list that was received on the final day had over 700 officers," he said. Fresh vetting ALSO READ:

However, yesterday, when we were expecting payment, we were told the list had swollen to over 700 officers," said an officer. "More names have been added on the list so some people can pocket our allowances," the officers said. On Saturday, the officers spent the entire day outside the office of County Commissioner Fredrick Shisia to push for their payment. Shisia said he was assessing complaints by the officers. He said he is also vetting the list and will ensure those who deserve to be paid get their money. "I am aware of that issue and we are cross-checking the list to establish the number of officers who had been engaged so they be paid," heÂ said.
