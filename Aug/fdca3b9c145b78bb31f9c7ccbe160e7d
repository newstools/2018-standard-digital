The names of streets in Meru County should reflect the heritage of the region, ward reps have said. The MCAs said various places and streets should bear names of local heroes and heroines. ALSO READ:

Officials will be arrested: Speaker The MCAs, who were debating a motion on renaming places to honour both departed and living heroes, noted that Meru is not short of people who have made the country proud. Muthara MCA Kinyua Toribu said street and place names that are not associated with the county should be replaced with those of local people who sacrificed in one way or another in service for the county. “Meru town (streets) currently have names that we do not recognise. We want to honour people such as Anarita Karimi Njeru, the first elected woman MP of South Imenti and the larger Meru,” said Mr Toribu, the Chairman of Justice and Legal Affairs Committee. Ms Njeru beat odds to win the seat in 1975, but did not finish her term. She was convicted and jailed for misappropriating funds during her stint as a school principal.  Toribu and Kiegoi-Antobochiu MCA Kimathi Ithibua said the late freedom fighter Field Marshall Musa Mwariama and the late Ciokaraine M’Barungu, the first woman assistant chief who reigned between 1954 and 1959, also deserve to be honoured. “Mwariama is one freedom struggle leader who was never caught. He emerged from the forest with his brigade and surrendered arms to the Government after the war was over," he said. Governor Kiraitu Murungi said his administration would name streets after Mau Mau heroes from Meru. ALSO READ:
