Nzomo jailed 12 years for assaulting spouse Naftali Luzuli (pictured above) denied the charges before Eldoret Chief Magistrate Charles Obulutsa and was granted a Sh300, 000 bond, with surety of a similar amount. "On August 10 at Kipkaren estate within Uasin Gishu, the suspect unlawfully caused grievous harm to Valerie Mueno Masibo," read the charges. The accused was arrested on Friday and booked at Ya Mumbi Police Post following reports that he had assaulted his wife. Before the charges were read in court, there was a moment of disbelief when Mr Luzuli claimed that his mrembo (beautiful one) had visited him at the police station following his arrest and that they were in the process of resolving the matter.  Surprised magistrate The reference appeared to surprise the magistrate, who asked: "Are you calling her your mrembo? She is now your mrembo?" Mr Obulutsa then asked if there were any witnesses to corroborate the claims. A relative of the victim however denied the claims and told the court the woman had gone to the police station to confirm that the suspect had been arrested. The accused, who was unrepresented, sat pensively as the charges were read, occasionally resting his head in his hands. ALSO READ:
