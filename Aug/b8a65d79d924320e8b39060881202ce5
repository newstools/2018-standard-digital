Transport and public works sector is expected to get the biggest share as the assembly allocated it Sh839 billion. The money has been set aside to rehabilitate roads, which were destroyed by rains recent recently. The health sector got Sh5,725 billion while agriculture department, lands and housing department was allocated Sh327 and Sh313 million respectively.  The budget estimates tabled in the assembly by Budget and Appropriation Committee chairman Kiiru Gachomba allocated the water and environment department Sh269 million while education sector got Sh269 million. Sh30 million was set aside for the governor's residence, a move that has since caused public outcry. There were, however, delays in passing the budget estimates as members clashed over 'misplaced' priorities. The members also questioned how the county has indicated that it was in the process of employing some 200 nursery tutors across the county yet their salaries and other expenses that come with the development was not factored in the budget.
