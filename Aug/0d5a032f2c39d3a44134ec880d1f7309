[Photo:Kipsang Joseph/Standard] Health services in some public hospitals in Nakuru were paralysed yesterday when medics boycotted work, demanding their salaries. The nurses, clinical officers and pharmacists were asking to be paid their July and August salaries. A nurses' representative, Bernard Njoroge, said the county had promised to pay the dues by next Tuesday. But the employees vowed that they would not report to work until they were paid. “We have nurses who have received eviction notices because they haven’t paid rent, while others cannot afford fare to their work stations,” said Mr Njoroge. The striking health workers were also demanding promotion for 400 nurses. Avoid becoming a victim of Fake News. Subscribe to the Standard Group SMS service by texting 'NEWS' to 22840. Emmarvelien Ondaro, a representative of nurses on contract, said they had also not received pay for July and August. Doctors had also threatened to go on strike, but the county paid their salaries yesterday. The county director of medical services, Solomon Sirma, said he could not comment on the matter because he was in a meeting in Nairobi.
