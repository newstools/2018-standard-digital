NAIROBI, KENYA: About 400 procurement and accounting officers have been cleared in the ongoing vetting ordered by President Uhuru Kenyatta on Madaraka Day. Government Spokesperson Eric Kiraithe said due to the employer/employee confidentiality terms, communication to the officers as to the condition of return, is to be effected by respective authorized officers.

Uhuru, Raila, Ruto in tough balancing act “The fresh vetting process for the first cohort of officers is about to be concluded. Due to the extenuating circumstances, the timelines for the vetting process extended beyond anticipatory period,” he said. “The next cohort of officers has been identified, and will shortly receive requisite details. Those who will not have been cleared to return to office will be processed in line with the existing human resource guidelines.” The Government in June ordered all heads of procurement and accounting units in ministries, departments, agencies and state corporations to step aside for fresh vetting. This follows a directive by President Uhuru Kenyatta on Madaraka Day celebrations to take the war against graft a notch higher.  “All heads of procurement and accounting units in ministries, departments, agencies and state corporations have been instructed to step aside with immediate effect. Before they vacate, they have also been instructed to hand over to their immediate deputies,” reads a memo from Government Spokesman Mwenda Njoka.
