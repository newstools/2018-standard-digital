[Photo: Boniface Gikandi One person died and two others injured after a building under construction at Kenol Market collapsed on Saturday. The workers were constructing an extension that had been halted by the physical planning department of the county government for violating the original design. The three-storey building developed cracks prompting physical planners and structural engineers to stop it. A witness Peter Kamau said he heard a crash only to come out of a nearby eatery and find the roof had collapsed. "We could hear people crying inside the rubble after the building came down," he said. He added: "The county government should stop ongoing construction of some buildings at Kenol Market until their safety is assured.
