DEVELOPING STORY: Protests rock Kampala The protests, led by activist Boniface Mwangi and area MCA Vincent Jagongo, were in reaction to claims that an investor was planning to construct hostels on the land. The students, armed with placards, gestured angrily as they marched. The protesters, who marched along the Kisumu-Busia road, accused the investor of infringing on the rights of the vulnerable students. They claimed the grabber had toured the land and informed the school of his intentions to develop it.  Orpa Ogut, the chairperson of the school's board of management, said the institution has owned the land since it was established in 1975. “The person claims he bought the land in 1981 but the land belongs to the school,” said Ogut.
