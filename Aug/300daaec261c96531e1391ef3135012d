State, donors to fund Sh12.7b roads upgrade The demonstrations were led by boda boda operators and drivers of vehicles that ply the route. They claimed their vehicles have constantly developed mechanical problems due to potholes on the road. “I operate Emali-Matiliku-Wote route and the matatu I drive has been bought through loan and with such a bad road our vehicles don’t give good returns since they often develop mechanical problems anytime,” one of the protesting drivers said. The road had been blocked few kilometers from Emali town, just before River Muoni. The enraged residents accused three MPs: Patrick Musimba (Kibwezi west), Daniel Maanzo (Makueni) and Joshua Kimilu (Kaiti) for not conveying their cries to the relevant authorities for the road to be upgraded.
