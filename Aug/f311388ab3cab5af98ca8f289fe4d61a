Sossion kicked out over 'misconduct' “We cannot just join the bandwagon. The agenda for the strike has not been well explained to us and hence we cannot support it,” said Kenya Primary School Heads Association (Kepsha) national chairman Shem Ndolo. Knut Secretary General Wilson Sossion called for the strike on September 1. Mr Sossion, a nominaed ODM MP, is scheduled to address the conference on Thursday morning. President Uhuru Kenyatta will address the 14th Kepsha annual delegates conference at Sheikh Zayed Centre Hall in Mombasa tomorrow. Mr Ndolo was flanked by Kisauni deputy County Commissioner Kipchumba Rutto, Kepsha Secretary General David Mavuta and treasurer Josephat Otiende, among other officials.
