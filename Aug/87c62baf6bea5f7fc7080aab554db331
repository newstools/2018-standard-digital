"I have heard the cry of the people. They should not be subjected to suffering," said Uhuru. This comes a month after residents staged a demonstration to protest the poor state of the road. The contractor, H-Young, had requested two months to submit a report.  In the run-up to the 2017 elections, Uhuru promised to personally monitor the road's progress. "The contractor is supposed to have completed the road by November this year. Clearing the bush is his role and he is supposed to do 50 metres on both sides," said Uhuru. The President has been at the Coast for the past 10 days and is said to have mostly been in Mombasa County. ALSO READ:
