Three pistols with 150 rounds of ammunition were at the weekend recovered from an abandoned house in Ruiru, Kiambu County. Police said they had received intelligence reports on the presence of the weapons- a Berretta, Ceska and Flare pistols. The flare pistol had a 12 gauge, police say. The weapons seem to have been licensed to an unnamed individual before they were recovered on Saturday. According to police, they were informed of the presence of the weapons there before they sought a warrant to search a house rented to a man who had left it in the custody of one Stephen Thungu. Thungu left the house unattended for the past three months. It was then that police were alerted and made the search and recovered the weapons. Know if news is factual and true.
