According to police, a lone gunman followed the victim to his car and shot him at close range in the head before escaping without stealing anything from him. A team of detectives who visited the scene were informed the victim had gone for prayers at a nearby mosque and was leaving for his house when he was attacked on August 18. He was walking to his car when a gunman who had been waiting at the entrance of the facility pursued him. His family said Mukhtar had complained of threats to his life. He shared his statement in which he named possible suspects behind the threats with his lawyers. Mukhtar had been sacked by the former Garissa administration and moved to court where he was awarded Sh50 million for wrongful sacking.
