Devolution Cabinet Secretary Eugene Wamalwa has said his recent unity with Ford Kenya leader Moses Wetang’ula will not be ruined in case there is a by-election. Speaking in Kongoli, Kanduyi constituency, Mr Wamalwa said he will support a Jubilee candidate in case a by-election is called in Kabuchai constituency. “I want to state that this will not affect my relationship with my brother Wetang’ula but it will only be fair competition and we will let the people of Kabuchi to decide,” he said. The Court of Appeal sitting in Kisumu on July 26 nullified the election of James Mukwe as the Kabuchai legislator few days after Wetang’ula and Wamalwa handshake. Mr Mukwe has, however, filed an application with the Supreme Court to challenge the nullification. Wamalwa has already started campaigns for the Jubilee candidate, Tale Nabangi, who challenged Mukwe’s win in the August 2017 election. The move has seemed to annoy the Kabuchai legislator, who has claimed that Wamalwa should stick to his portfolio instead of meddling in their affairs.  Mukwe has said that Wamalwa should focus his energies in his portfolio instead of coming to choose leadership for the people of Kabuchai. “People should not come here in the guise of the handshake to come chose the leadership of Kabuchai. Let him Wamalwa stick in Transnzoia,” said Mukwe. Political analysts argue that the by election could be a litmus test for the handshake between Wetang’ula and Wamalwa as the two leaders will be keen in backing one of their candidates.
