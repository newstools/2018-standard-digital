Teams agree to decongest KNH Kenya Union of Domestic, Hotels, Educational, Institutions and Hospital Workers (Kudhehia), which represents the workers, had given the Government up to yesterday to pay the money. “We are saying that if there will be no money by August 5, KNH employees will down their tools,” said Kudhehia Secretary General Albert Njeru. The strike will affect all medical services, as nurses and staff from other medical cadres belong to Kudhehia. Only doctors will not participate in the strike, they are not members of Kudhehia. KNH has 1,400 nurses. All other subordinate staff will also take part in the strike.  A meeting slated for July 12, where the matter was to be discussed with a view of averting the strike, was cancelled at the eleventh hour. In 2005, SRC recommended a health service allowance before issuing a second circular, which excluded some workers out. “Employees in the support department in the health sub-sectors do not qualify to be paid health workers service allowance,” a circular from the SRC reads. KNH sought funds to implement the allowances that were to be paid in two phases of 60 and 40 per cent in January and July last year. ALSO READ:
