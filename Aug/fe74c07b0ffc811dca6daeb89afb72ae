 A Christian organisation has launched a revised version of the Bible for Maa speaking people. “Biblia Sinyati” was launched over the weekend by the Bible Society of Kenya. It was completed after seven years of research and compilation. According to Bible Society of Kenya officials, “Biblia Sinyati” is a more readable version of the Maasai Bible. It will serve the Maasai of Kenya and Tanzania. “At the Bible Society of Kenya, our mission is to ensure that every Christian within the borders can read and understand the word of God,” said Elizabeth Muriuki, Chief Executive Officer, Bible Society of Kenya. The society has translated the Bible into 21 local languages and also done several Bible revisions and Bible portions for school-going children. Know if news is factual and true.
