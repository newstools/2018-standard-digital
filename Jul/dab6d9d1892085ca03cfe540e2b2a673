Exclusive: 5000- strong Chinese army behind SGR walls Using the hashtag #IStandWithWafula, Kenyans on Tuesday condemned the Government for what they said was bullying and threatening the reporter who is just doing his work by being the voice of the voiceless- the Kenyan workers contracted to work on the SGR. The reporter exposed an appalling investigative story that unearthed the killing of wild animals, Sh1billion monthly expense to run the SGR, racism discrimination, harassment, mistreatment of  local workers and Chinese workers domination among other claims that have rubbed the SGR managers and contractors China Road and Bridge Company(CRBC) the wrong way. This writer was not however, able to establish if indeed the reporter has been threatened over the story. The exposé has caused huge outcry in the public forcing Kenya Railways to launch independent investigations into the mistreatment claims. Avoid fake news!
