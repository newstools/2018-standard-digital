The Lugari MP has warned that wrangles in the Jubilee Party were denting the Government's image. According to Ayub Savula of the Amani National Congress party, the wrangles were sending the wrong signals to the public and could erode the trust and respect that President Uhuru Kenyatta and his deputy, William Ruto, command.

They ought to have this perception corrected before things get out of hand,” Mr Savula told The Standard yesterday. He argued that for the Government to deliver its mandate, the two leaders must be seen to be working together. “You saw the President issue executive orders stopping new projects while Ruto was busy launching a new medical training college at Navakholo in Kakamega," said Savula. Political contest  He said leaders should concentrate on serving the people who elected them instead of engaging in politics. On the Mau Narok eviction debate, Savula accused leaders of turning the matter into a political contest. “There are those making this issue look political and this is making the country look bad in the eyes of the international community. It would be better if a survey was conducted to establish the legitimate land owners and have them resettled elsewhere,” said the legislator. He said it was inhumane to throw children out in the cold as the forest encroachers were evicted. His Shinyalu counterpart, Justus Kizito, criticised Senate Majority Leader Kipchumba Murkomen for his stand on the evictions. ALSO READ:
