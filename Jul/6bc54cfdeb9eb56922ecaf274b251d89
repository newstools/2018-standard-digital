Frederick Beuchi embarked on a 12-day walk to Mombasa, covering 482 kilometres. His unusual journey is one born of love for his sister, a love that has turned into a passion to fight for others suffering from the disease that has long afflicted his sibling â€“ epilepsy.

Beuchi said that in Kwale, where he comes from, the disease was misunderstood and the condition steeped in stigma, with witchcraft overtones. It was not until 2013, he said, that his 11-year-old sister got the medical attention that changed her life and spurred him to try to spread hope.
