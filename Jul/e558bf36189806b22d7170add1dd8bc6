Split in Raila party over choice for Migori seat The party cited time and financial constraints ahead of the October 8 by-elections for its decision to award the direct nomination. “Aspirants who showed interest in the seat were invited to Nairobi yesterday and had a meeting with the Central Committee together with the NEB and were taken through the process of nomination. They all agreed to the decision on direct nomination,” it said in a statement. The party’s constitution allows it to hold direct nominations, use delegates system or universal suffrage to pick its candidate. Clinching the ODM ticket is an almost assurance of being elected, given the party is the most popular in the region.  The seat fell vacant following the death of Senator Ben Oluoch last month. Last week, Jubilee Party announced it will not field a candidate in the by-election as a way of fostering a unity pact between President Uhuru Kenyatta and Mr Odinga.
