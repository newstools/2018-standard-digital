Some of the measures include posting more police officers on the islands, opening more police posts and increasing marine police patrols on the lake. “A time has come when the harassment of Kenyan fishermen working at the lake must stop,” said Mr Matiang’i. He added: “It is unfortunate that when our fishermen go into the lake, they are arrested and their fishing gear confiscated.” Speaking when he met the Homa Bay security team led by County Commissioner Irungu Macharia, Matiang’i did not however mention Uganda, whose officers have been hounding and arresting Kenyan fishermen.  Matiang’i’s tough talk come in the wake of recent reports of arrests of Kenyan fishermen by Ugandan security officials in Lake Victoria. Fishermen in the area have accused the State of laxity in ending their tribulations.
