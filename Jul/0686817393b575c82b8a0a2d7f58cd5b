Confusion over presidential orders risk to growth agenda Wetang'ula said a lot of money was lost in State offices, yet the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission looked away, instead focusing on Governors over 'little' money. At the same time, he warned that the Government's borrowing might spiral out of control, adding that the debt, which, he said, stood at Sh5 trillion, was likely to hurt the economy. According to Wetang'ula, the country owes 70 per cent of its debts to China and could lose some resources if not paid, as happened to Sri Lanka, which lost control of its main port to China because of an outstanding debt. He cited the Standard Gauge Railway as one of the projects that had eaten into the country's economy and that might turn out to be a failure. “We are supposed to pay Sh100 billion annually for the rail, yet it cannot raise Sh30 billion,” he said.
