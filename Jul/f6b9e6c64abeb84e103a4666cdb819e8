The variable in the power bill are pass through costs and are aimed at cushioning power industry players from incurring losses brought about by such factors as the surge in oil prices, weakening of the shilling against major global currencies and increase cost of acquisition of power equipment that might result from high inflation. They are in addition to the energy consumption charge. In the new structure, which becomes effective August 1, domestic consumers will pay Sh16.60 per unit of electricity consumed. ERC also said there was an overall reduction in the amount paid by domestic consumers within the lifeline tariff, which is a subsidised regime for low income customers using under 10 units per month. This accounts form 3.6 million, or about half of Kenya Power consumers. It previously allowed customers to consumer up to 50 units at a subsidised rate.
