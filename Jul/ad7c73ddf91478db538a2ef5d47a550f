This is his second prison break: in 2013, he escaped after taking four guards hostage as human shields and destroying a number of doors. He staged that escape less than half an hour after arriving at a prison in northern France. In 2009 he wrote a book about his experiences of growing up in Paris's crime-ridden suburbs and graduating into a life of crime.  He claimed to have turned his back on crime, but a year later he was involved in the failed robbery for which he was imprisoned at the Seine-et-Marne prison. Faid and his accomplices escaped from the prison courtyard - which was unprotected by a net - without injuring anyone, French news website Europe 1 reports. The helicopter then flew to the nearby Bourget area. It was then found burnt out by local police. ALSO READ:
