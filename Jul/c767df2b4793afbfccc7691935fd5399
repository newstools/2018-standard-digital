Woman denies stealing baby Their third accomplice, John Mwangi, will be buried today in Njumbi area in Mathioya Sub-county. There were no written eulogies and the ceremonies lacked coordination, as locals failed to participate in the preparations for fear of being labelled sympathisers of criminals. The burials took less than an hour, and only close relatives participated. After Kiamani’s body was interred, the villagers flocked to Wambui’s compound when a contingent of officers from Kahuro police station showed up. There was no preaching as clerics also kept away.

Karanja Muiru, Kimani’s uncle, said the family has earned a bad name following the kidnapping, saying the man had ignored calls to stop the crime. “Death of Kimani follows his ignorance from advice by elders severally to stop associating himself with gangs,” he said. Prophet John Njaramba said the youth should mend their ways and avoid being part of the criminal gangs that have dominated Nairobi Kayole estate. “I have buried many of the youth over their involvement with criminal gangs. I was a former gangster but after I realised threats involved I changed my ways,” said Njaramba. ALSO READ:
