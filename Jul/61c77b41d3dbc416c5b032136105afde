A witness Alex Wambugu told how two police cars blocked the car ferrying the suspects before they were arrested and whisked to the police station. Wambugu added that the four were heading to Nakuru from Nairobi before they were arrested in an incident that saw the flow of traffic temporarily paralysed along the busy highway. “At one time the heavily armed officers had to shoot in the air to stop the suspects from fleeing and they recovered some laptops and other electronics,” he said.
