Dr Samson Machuka, the Director of Monitoring and Evaluation at the Treasury said in an interview that in a country where graft is endemic, state-sponsored infrastructure projects have become strong conduits for corrupt bureaucrats to milk public coffers. This is when projects are budgeted for and tenders awarded, but no monitoring or evaluation is done to understand what value these projects brought to the taxpayer. “You will find that in a country like South Africa, Monitoring and Evaluation is given a whole ministry. In Uganda it’s a whole commission. But Kenya its just a unit which is not very well funded. It makes monitoring the projects a bit hard,” said Dr Machuka. Avoid fake news!

The conference will seek ways to find out how this research can be utilized,” Machuka averred.
