After Maina denied the charge, defence lawyer Charles Gachichio applied to have the officer freed on bail, arguing that he was not a flight risk. But the prosecutor opposed the bail application, saying he was waiting for a comprehensive investigation report from the Independent Policing Oversight Authority (Ipoa) that would indicate whether Maina would interfere with prosecution witnesses. The court rejected Mr Namiti's appeal to hold Maina for seven days awaiting the Ipoa findings and instead ordered the prosecution to produce the report today before a ruling on bail could be made.
