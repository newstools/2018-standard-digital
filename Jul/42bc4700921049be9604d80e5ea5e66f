The petition had been received with heavy criticism as MPs allied to opposition leader Raila Odinga claimed it was a scheme to lock out the former premier from 2022 presidential race. “The prayer to amend Article 137 of the Constitution of Kenya 2010 on the qualifications for legibility to run for election as president and to set the retirement age of the President at the age of 70 years be disallowed as it is discriminatory,” says the report. “Certain State officers such as Judges and Magistrates are subjected to a retirement age except political offices because these unique offices of leadership and wisdom, both traits that advances with age,” states the report.

The team further said that it was not factual that every person experiences medical challenges and life-threatening diseases as they age. “Indeed some elder members of society are fruitful and very productive in their old age,” notes the report.
