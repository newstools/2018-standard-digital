Speaking to The Standard, the police officer said they have launched investigations into the incident. “We are asking the public against taking the law into their hands. They (public) should hand over suspected criminals to the law enforcement officers for action instead of attacking them,” Kombo cautioned. The incident comes at a time when cases of the elderly being killed on suspicion of practicing witchcraft continue to rise in the region. In the past two months, two elderly men aged about 70-years had been hacked to death on claims that they practice witchcraft and wizard in Nyangala division, Voi Sub County.
