Wounded by World Cup attack, Uganda ups security for final The author gives insight into the political events around the 2017 elections and concludes that what should have been Kenya’s free and fair vote turned out to be the most tainted of the multiparty era. “The elections were so flawed that their true account would be established only through an independent audit, such as the one led by former South African Judge Johann Kriegler into the 2007 elections,” Mr Onyando said in a statement to the media. The writer, who was a communication official in NASA, also reports that while Opposition chief Raila Odinga was popular, his campaign secretariat was too dysfunctional to deliver victory.
