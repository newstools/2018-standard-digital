They feared their father because he frequently disciplined them over wayward behaviour,” she said. She said her husband brought the children to their house at around 2am and beat them using a pipe. The following morning, the boy, a Standard Five pupil at Mbaranga Primary School, succumbed to the injuries he sustained from the beating. The younger sister aged eight was injured on the legs and hands. One of her ankles was also cracked. ALSO READ:
