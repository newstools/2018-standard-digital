The court was packed to capacity as residents turned up in large numbers to have a glimpse of their former Bishop take a plea. Bishop Angela’s wife and children were among the many people who jammed the court. In a dark suit, a white shirt and checked tie, Bishop Angela arrived in court under tight security shortly before 10 am. He stood composed in the dock guarded by a lone police officer.  He lifted his head and stared at the Magistrate as the Court clerk read the charges against him- that he defiled a minor contrary to section 8 (1) of the Sexual Offenses Act 2006. The court heard that on the night of  June 27 and 28, 2018 at Majiwa village, Bar-Chando Sub-Location in Bondo Sub-County he forcefully and intentionally had carnal knowledge of a 15-year-old minor. He was also charged with an alternative count of committing an indecent act with the child contrary to section 11 (1) of the Sexual Offenses Act 2006, by intentionally touching the private parts of the minor, charges that he all denied. Speaking in low tones, the retired prelate denied the charges as his lawyer, Mr Stephen Kopot, put a request for bail. ALSO READ:
