The Kenya Urban Roads Authority (Kura) had maintained there would be no compensation for the residents as the land belongs to government. Kura Communication Officer, John Cheboi observed that a majority of the structure owners were landlords living in Langata and they would only be assisting the families directly affected. “You cannot compensate someone for land that they do not own because they do not have title deeds. We will however give out something ‘small’ to help the residents relocate. They will also be allowed to carry their structural materials,” added Cheboi.  ALSO READ:
