Board disbanded over incompetency In his appeal, Waity wants a judgement dated January 31 by Lady Justice Mary Kasango at the Nanyuki High Court set aside and the governor’s election invalidated. Waity is also contesting orders to pay Sh12 million as legal costs of the petition. Waity described the costs as exorbitant, excessive and contrary to the Advocates Remuneration Order. Kuyo argued that the appellant had failed to prove allegations of massive material discrepancies, errors and irregularities in the statutory electoral forms produced in court during hearing of the case challenging his victory in last year's General Election. The lawyer said the burden to produce proof of massive irregularities in Laikipia West and North lay with the appellant, whom Kuyo described as being on a fishing expedition.  “He has failed to produce any evidence to substantiate his allegations." Kuyo told justices Fatuma Sichale, Asike Makhandia and Sankale ole Kantai there was no evidence on record to warrant the High Court to issue orders for the scrutiny of votes in all polling stations in Sossian Ward. But Waity argued that the judge erred in expunging testimonies of six key witnesses and allowing the withdrawal of a second petitioner, Dennis Leman. The court will deliver judgement on July 31.
