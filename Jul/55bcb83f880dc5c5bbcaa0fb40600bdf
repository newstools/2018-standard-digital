Committee chairman Senator Moses Kajwang’ said they could not proceed without the documents showing he had satisfactorily complied with a requirement by the auditor. “We want quality to be the heart of our proceedings. It will not be productive for us as a committee to continue with this session without seeing the documents you are referring to in your responses,” the Homa Bay lawmaker told Mutua.

My assumption was that the documents I submitted last year are still valid and figured out that we don’t need to incur extra costs making photocopies,” he said. He apologised and said the error was caused by miscommunication. In his report, the Auditor General said the governor's office had not provided documents to show how Sh7 billion was spent.
