Mr Wamwea reported the matter at the nearby Kasarani police station. According to Wamwea, Ms Njoki confronted him outside the hotel, accusing him of being fronted by Governor Mwangi wa Iria to remove 'rebels' from positions of leadership in the assembly. “I was attacked in full view of the members present, but I restrained myself, before assembly's security personnel intervened. I moved to report the matter to Kasarani police station,” said Wamwea.  No comment Wambui declined to comment on the matter, saying it would not add any value. "As of now I don't wish to be drawn into the matter," she said. Assembly Speaker Nduati Kariuki said he was not aware of the clash but promised to investigate. ALSO READ:
