Hundreds of Kibera residents have been given 12 days to demolish structures to pave way for the construction of Ngong Road-Kibera-Kungu Karumba-Langata link road. In a statement signed by the NationalÂ Building Inspectorate Secretary Moses Nyakiongora, said those who do not comply with the orders will be forcefully evacuated. "Upon the expiry of this notice, any structures or property found on the specified corridor will be demolished or removed from the road reserve at the trespassers' risk and cost," the statement read. The structures are a hindrance to the road construction and have slowed down the work since the tender was awarded to a Japanese Company World Kogyo Kaihatsu in 2016. Kibera Member of Parliament Ken Okoth has asked the government to make sure the affected residents would be fully compensated. "I call upon the Cabinet Secretary in charge of roads to make sure the affected persons are relocated in a humane fashion and given fair compensation as per the Constitution of Kenya and the laws and guidelines on evictions and resettlement. The IDP Act 2012 is clear on the rights of citizens affected by development projects and the guidelines for compensation and resettlement," MP Ken Okoth said. Know if news is factual and true.
