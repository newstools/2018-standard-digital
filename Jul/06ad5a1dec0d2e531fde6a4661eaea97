Iten County Referral Hospital has received its first CT scan machine. The medical equipment is expected to enable the facility handle numerous cases requiring emergency care, cases often arising from road crashes, cattle rustling and banditry in Kerio Valley. Elgeyo Marakwet has been relying on Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital for such specialised service. Dr Mary Waigwa, a radiologist at the hospital, said its installation would significantly reduce the challenges involved in handling patients. Just a few kilometres away from the hospital is Keiyo Valley – an epicenter of ethnic conflicts that often end in severe injuries. “A large number of people get bullet injuries. Others nurse head and other body injuries. They often succumb to injuries owing to delays in finding medical attention. This will longer be the case,” said Waigwa. Due to the big number of patients seeking services at the facility, the administrator Paul Ateya said they have not satisfied their demands with the old CT scan. Some are forced to go to other hospitals outside the county. Avoid becoming a victim of Fake News. Subscribe to the Standard Group SMS service by texting 'NEWS' to 22840. Iten County Referral Hospital is among 36 other public health facilities that are being equipped with a CT scan machine, beneficiaries of a project being implemented by the Ministry of Health under the Managed Equipment Services (MES).
