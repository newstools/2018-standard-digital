Malindi Transporters Association Sacco have been denied permission to hold a demonstration against alleged harassment by Kenya National Highway Authority (KeNHA) in Malindi town.

Motorists using Nairobi –Nakuru highway to experience traffic disruption They accused the officials of tampering with the weighbridges to extort truckers who "exceeded the maximum weights limit set". On Monday Jared Makori, KeNHA's Coast manager denied knowledge of these claims after the transporters made them over the weekend. On Tuesday, the truckers petitioned Malindi police to protest in Malindi town but this was turned down, allegedly, on security grounds.

But speaking to The Standard on phone yesterday, Malindi OCPD Matawa Muchangi said he was not aware of the planned protest which was to be held on Wednesday. “I have not been told and I am not even aware,” said Mr Muchangi. The chairman of the Sacco, Francis Kagema, claimed the organisation submitted the letter to Malindi OCS Steve Muchai who refused to receive the letter and said that the protest was a security threat. “We had drafted a notice to inform the police about our protest. I took it to the OCS who told me he is not receiving it for security reasons. He did not want to hear how we had organised ourselves and said we should go to the OCPD,” said Kagema. ALSO READ:
