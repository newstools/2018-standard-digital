Don't read this if you have a job Apart from Helb, job seekers are required to get compliance certificates from the Kenya Revenue Authority (KRA) and the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission (EACC). Others are a certificate of good conduct from the Directorate of Criminal Investigations, and a letter from Credit Reference Bureau (CRB) indicating the applicant doesn’t owe any financial institution money. The bill, that has been submitted to the National Assembly Speaker Justin Muturi and is awaiting formal introduction in the floor of the House, seeks to amend section 5 of the Employment Act. Bill proposes  Keter in the bill proposes the addition of a new sub-section in the Act. It requires a Two-thirds majority to sail through the House. “The Cabinet Secretary shall waive any fee imposed on a person categorised as a youth or as a person with disability, where it is mandatory to obtain the requisite clearance certificates in accessing employment at first instance,” reads the bill in part. Speaking to The Standard yesterday, Mr Keter said thousands of job-seekers are unfairly being locked out from job opportunities because of the requirement to pay for the clearance certificates.
