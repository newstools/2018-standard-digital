Let’s support and consciously work towards the shaping of boys today, or we risk having a generation of irresponsible men in future,” said Mr Macharia. The tournament, held at the Nairobi West Prison in Nairobi, brought together 12 teams from the church’s branches located in different stations in Nairobi.
