Police blamed for laxity as cattle theft escalates “Loomwa Ngoya from Dodoth District in Uganda was on June 19 abducted by Turkana raiders while herding cattle in Turkana West. Luckily, the boy was neither harmed nor intimidated by the raiders," said David Ekomwa, the county peace-building officer. The boy was rescued from cattle rustlers who had crossed over from the Turkana side. He was placed under the care of Turkana West Sub-county administrator Esther Kiyonga. "We had to take care of the boy as we negotiated the whereabouts of his parents and organised on how to take him back to his country. Finally, the handover was done," Ekomwa said. Turkana Deputy County Commissioner Noah Tanui said people engaging in rustling should be dealt with according to the law. Know if news is factual and true.
