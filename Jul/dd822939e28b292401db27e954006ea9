The "embarrassed" 22-year-old was later found hanged in a wood in Monmouthshire. Senior coroner Wendy James said: "Despite having the support of a loving family, it was not enough for him to get through a stressful period in his life. "Not knowing what the ramifications would be, he felt isolated and became overwhelmed.  "It is not unusual for young people to make mistakes. But his biggest mistake was dwelling on that one mistake." The inquest heard that Mr Senior died in February after the complaint about his WhatsApp post was raised.
