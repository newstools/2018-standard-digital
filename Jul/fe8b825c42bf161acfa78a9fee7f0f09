Kingi explains ties with DP Ruto MCAs turned away Mr Adan, citing ‘credibility issues’. Kadu Asili nominated MCA Humphrey Mwarandu expressed concern about Adan’s academic qualifications after members were presented with two different curriculum vitae. But Governor Amason Kingi (right) yesterday submitted Adan’s name again. Mwarakaya MCA Alphonse Mwayaa, the majority chief whip, said he was not aware of the development. He added that he would not support Mr Kingi’s choice.  The president of the Kilifi University Students Association, Fikirini Jacob, accused the governor of trying to impose an unpopular appointee. The assembly clerk, Silas Mulewa, said he had received Adan’s name on Friday but had yet to present it to for fresh vetting. “I am waiting for the members to resume to forward his name to the house,” he added.
