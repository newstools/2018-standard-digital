Oketch said overnight the man was seen seated in isolation ordering lots of the spirit.  Other witness claimed that he appeared to have been stressed as he continued to consume the drink. It was not clear why the bar employees allowed him to drink until morning and never raised an alarm even when he fell on the floor from where his body was discovered in the morning. "He appeared to have been still alive at around 7 am. He was groaning as he lay on the floor and people thought he had blacked out, only to find that he was already dead," said another witness.
