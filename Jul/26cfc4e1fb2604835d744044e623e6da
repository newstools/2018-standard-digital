The three have sued the AG, the Ministry of Transport and Infrastructure CS, KPA and KRC for transferring operations of the Port of Mombasa to Embakasi Internal Container Deport.  The three, through lawyer Nyambura Kihoro, applied to have a five-judge bench make a declaration that the September 30, 2014 agreement between KPA and KRC moving port operations to Nairobi through Standard Gauge Railway threatened the social and economic rights of Mombasa residents.
