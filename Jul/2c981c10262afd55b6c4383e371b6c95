He added: “Some of our colleagues have been separated from their families. Imagine a teacher being transferred from Migori County to Vihiga and his wife taken to Narok.

He called for change of leadership at the Kenya National Examination Council, after it claimed some students were torching schools to evade the forthcoming national examinations. “Do you want to tell me the students of Maranda, Kisii School, Meru School, and Kisumu Girls fear exams yet they have always performed well? The students are worried that somebody up there is not listening especially when their teachers speak,”Sosion said. On the proposal to introduce similar uniforms in all public schools, Mr Sossion said that the move is misinformed and merely meant to benefit a few people, who will be awarded the tenders to supply the uniforms to schools, like it is with text books.
