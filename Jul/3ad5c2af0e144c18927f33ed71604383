He added that the automation process began late last year when the contract was awarded to SAP (East Africa), a German multinational software corporation that makes enterprise software. “The new platform will put the KPC at par with its peers who are already using the e-procurement platform which has allowed their finance and procurement departments to streamline their processes,” said Sang.
