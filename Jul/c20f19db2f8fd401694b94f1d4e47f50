Seven cabinet nominees appointed by Governor Alfred Mutua were sworn into office yesterday, despite protests by some Members of the County Assembly (MCAs). The nominees, who were appointed last week, took oath of office in a ceremony witnessed by Machakos Chief Magistrate Alfred Kibiru. The new appointees later joined three others, who were retained by Dr Mutua from his previous regime, for the first full cabinet meeting since last year’s elections. Ward representatives, led by Kinanie MCA Mark Muendo, termed the appointment of the new cabinet members as ‘an illegality and abuse of powers’ by the county chief. Last week, MCAs declined to admit a report by the committee on appointments, which was to be tabled before the assembly to either approve or reject Dr Mutua’s nominees who had been vetted earlier by the assembly. The MCAs cited the pending election petition case lodged by former Kathiani MP Wavinya Ndeti against Mutua as the reason they could not debate the report on CEC appointments.
