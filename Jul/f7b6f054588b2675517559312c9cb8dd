What started as an earnest move to ascertain the truth behind claims of suspect sugar in the market could amount to nothing. Early this year, the red flag went up following claims that unscrupulous traders had imported sugar that bore traces of mercury and other metals harmful to human beings. It was a claim that could not be taken lightly, given its direct bearing on the lives of millions of Kenyans who consume sugar. The necessity for a probe became apparent; a task that was assigned a parliamentary committee. ALSO READ:

CS Rotich in trouble for snubbing MPs over sugar But while Kenyans eagerly await a conclusive report following tests, they have been treated to conflicting reports from members of the same government.
