The price of cotton has improved marginally in Mt Kenya East. A kilo is fetching Sh46 up from Sh40 last year, marking improved earning for farmers. Speaking during a farmer’s forum in the cotton belt of Kanyangi in Mbeere North at the weekend, farmers said the earnings offer better returns than five years ago when a kilo fetched Sh25. Njue Mbothere, a farmer, said he prefers cotton to maize farming as the former is drought tolerant. Another farmer Joseph Nyaga said cotton farming is capital- intensive considering that a farmer has to spray a lot to contain pests. The farmers called on the Government to assist them form cooperatives that would give them loans, subsidised inputs and extension services.
