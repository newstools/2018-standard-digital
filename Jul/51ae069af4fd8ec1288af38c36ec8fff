Three bank employees and a guard were yesterday charged with stealing Sh20 million last week. The operations supervisor, Cyrus Mugo, tellers Nancy Njeri and Sally Mureithi and Robert Ndururi, the guard, denied the charges yesterday. They were charged that on the night of July 14 and 15, at Family Bank's Ruiru branch, they jointly broke in and stole Sh19, 204,563, 210 euros and $570. Mr Mugo, Ms Njeri and Ms Mureithi also faced a second count of stealing by servant. Mr Ndururi faced a second count that, being a security guard at the bank, he knowingly neglected to prevent the theft. Kiambu Senior Principal Magistrate Stella Atambo released Charity Wanjiku and Jane Wanjiru, the bank’s branch and operations managers respectively, unconditionally.  The prosecutor, Christine Mbevi, asked the court to let them go and order that all their personal effects that had been confiscated by police be released. The two had been remanded at Kiambu Police Station since Monday last week as detectives carried out investigations. The prosecution told the court it was not opposed to the accused being released on bail. “The prosecution only wants the bail terms to be adequate, taking into consideration the amount of money the bank lost and the nature of the charges,” said the prosecution counsel. The magistrate will today rule on whether the accused should be released on bail. She ordered that they be held at the Kiambu Police Station.
