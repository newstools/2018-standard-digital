Ethiopian, Eritrean leaders in historic meeting They were reunited in scenes of tearful joy and relief after the first commercial flight between the two nations in 20 years landed in Eritrea's capital, Asmara. "My suffering has ended - I have met my daughters and kissed them, and poured my tears," Addisalem told local media. His reunion with his daughters, who are not twins as reported earlier, filled him with "so much peace and hope", he added.

My life was without meaning, without taste. The border was closed to Ethiopians, so I could not go after her. I felt like I had died," Addisalem said. "I used to wish my family had moved to any other country - because it would have been easier to visit them there than to cross the border into Eritrea." Ethiopian Airlines called the flight to Eritrea - the first since the 1998-2000 border war - the "bird of peace".

More than 450 passengers were on board the aircraft, Ethiopia's privately owned Addis Standard news site reported. Demand was so high that a second flight left within 15 minutes, according to AFP news agency.
