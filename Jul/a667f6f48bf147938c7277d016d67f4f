Zambia is the biggest Copper Mine Country in Africa. Its reserves are 22 million tons, accounting for 83%. of the total reserves in Africa We are so hour could be cooperated with one of the biggest Copper Mine in Zambia. Our technical groups are going to the mine site twice, and stay there about 1month for Pump It needs longer transfer distance for the mine slag, about 120m Pump head needed. For the normal horizontal slurry pump, 75m is the highest Pump head. Our technicals decided to design a new pump type, the total head could be 125m, the trial head could be 130m. Perfectly solved this problem.
Marvelu Website Marvelu technical groups looking around the whole mine site, designed the special copper mine pumping system, this system included horizontal slurry pump, vertical sump pump,Submersible Slurry Pump end suction water pump,, pipes, valves. Marvelu pump Group Heavy Duty Slurry Pump For Coal Mining 1. General Introduction  MZJ series Slurry Pump is newly designed anti-wear, corrosion resistant slurry pump.
