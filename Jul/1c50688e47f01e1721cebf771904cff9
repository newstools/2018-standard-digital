How can police officers come with four armoured personnel carriers and shoot unarmed residents?

Meru County Commissioner Wilfred Nyagwanga declined to comment on the operation, saying although the affected village was in Meru, the operation was being conducted by security officers from Isiolo. His Isiolo counterpart John Ondego, however, said only one person was killed.
