MCAs in trouble over tablets, lounge plan Governor Kinyanjui (pictured) wants the ward reps to reduce allocations to their area’s development kitty from Sh20 million to Sh10 million to release funds for stalled projects. Early this year, the ward reps passed the County Revenue Allocation Act that set a minimum of Sh20 million for each of the 55 wards for development. The leaders have stood their ground saying the ward kitty should not be reduced and that the executive must make use of the Sh2 billion allocated to the office of the governor to fund stalled projects.

Yesterday, Ndung’u said it was important for the executive and the assembly to agree on the spending proposals. The budget estimates were scheduled to be tabled on June 30, but the exercise has been delayed due to the stalemate. The row between Governor Kinyanjui’s administration and the ward reps began in April with the leaders protesting against delays in tabling crucial budget documents. ALSO READ:
