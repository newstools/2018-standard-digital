They will be expected to offer modern and innovative, quality services to mothers and children throughout the first 1,000 days after delivery. Deputy Governor Joash Maangi noted the programme would boost access to health services. “We need such programmes to boost access to health services, especially for pregnant women and children under five years who are the most vulnerable,” he said.
