We have visited his house and we found some documents of people he is likely to have been lying to that he is in a position to grant them jobs in the military,” said Mr Omanga. He observed that the suspect was arrested in Eldoret after he began harassing locals and police officers in the region. “He was intimidating our officers urging them to arrest another individual while demanding for Sh100,000. In his possession were documents of people seeking jobs, evidence that he must have taken money from them while pretending to give out positions,” he added. Avoid becoming a victim of Fake News.
