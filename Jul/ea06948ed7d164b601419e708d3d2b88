MPs on the spot for cosy act during probe Mr Muturi stopped parallel investigations into matters being probed by other agencies and issued guidelines on how MPs relate with witnesses following protests about some committees being too cozy with persons of interest. “It rests upon each Committee to decide and resolve on the urgency of the inquiry they propose to undertake. If an investigative agency is conducting a parallel investigation, and where prosecution has preferred charges on individuals of interest to the committee on matters similar to those before it, the inquiry before the committee should be suspended,” said Muturi.
