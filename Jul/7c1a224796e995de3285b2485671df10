'Copious pages' According to the court documents, Mr Zhang was hired in 2015 to develop software and hardware for Apple's autonomous vehicle project. However, after visiting China in April 2018 he told his supervisor he planned to move to the country to work for Xiaopeng Motors. The supervisor informed Apple's security team, which found that Zhang had downloaded "copious pages of information" from secret databases and had taken hardware from its autonomous vehicle lab, the court documents allege.
