A family is seeking justice for its kin who was found dead in Isiolo County. The body of Kelvin Nyanga, 23, a Rapid Deployment Unit (RDU) officer at Ngarmara Camp until his death about three weeks ago, had gunshot wounds. Marcella Karenga, his sister, said the RDU in Isiolo claimed Mr Nyanga had committed suicide. "The family is calling for justice from the Government and we would like the Kenya National Commission on Human Rights to fast-track the process of finding out the truth about my brother's death," said Ms Karenga. She said Nyanga's relatives wanted to know the circumstances of his death. "If he was killed, the culprit must be brought to book. We have a right to know," Karenga said during Nyanga's burial at Lorugum in Loima on Saturday. The family said the RDU did not give him a ceremonial send-off because of the claims that he had committed suicide. Leaders who attended the burial, who included three MCAs, Loima MP Jeremiah Lomorukai and Thirdway Alliance party leader Ekuru Aukot, said they supported the family's sentiments.
