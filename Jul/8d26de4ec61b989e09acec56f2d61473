"No one has bothered to write to us as the law (public order and management act) so demands. What do you do to people that break the law? Apprehend them," said Kayima. Activists who include opposition legislators, artists and civil society have urged the public to come into the capital Kampala protesting the daily fee of 200 shillings (0.05 U.S. dollars) for social media use and 0.5 percent excise duty on mobile money transactions.
