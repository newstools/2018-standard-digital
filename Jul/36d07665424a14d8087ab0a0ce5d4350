Governor Joseph ole Lenku has supported the ongoing eviction of illegal settlers from Mau Narok forest. Speaking for the first time on issue, the governor said the conservation of the water tower must be supported by all Kenyans. “I fully support and identify myself with the eviction. Mau forest must be reclaimed now. I am shocked that some people have made it appear like we have an alternative,” said Mr Lenku. He accused some leaders of trying to introduce ethnicity in the evictions and called for more protection for all forests. ALSO READ:
