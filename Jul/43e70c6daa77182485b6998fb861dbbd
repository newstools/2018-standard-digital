A county assembly ICT committee has cautioned City Hall against terminating the contract of Jambo Pay, Nairobi’s mandated revenue collector. This is in the wake of a Public Accounts Committee (PAC) report, which had called for the termination of the electronic payment platform services on the basis that the county got a raw deal.

Kisumu County automates revenue collection in bid to raise Sh1b ICT committee chair Osman Adow yesterday observed that the county had no alternative revenue collection system in place, and doing away with the service provider would only translate to loss in revenue for City Hall. Jambo pay was contracted by Governor Evans Kidero in 2014 and has automated 136 out of 138 revenue streams. The bulk of the revenue streams have been automated during Governor Mike Sonko’s tenure. Only 14 revenue streams had been automated by the time Sonko took over from Kidero. According to the ICT committee, this has seen the county revenue collections increase from Sh7 billion to approximately Sh14 billion a year. Know if news is factual and true.
