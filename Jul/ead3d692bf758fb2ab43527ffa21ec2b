Why Uber drivers will not access rider’s phone number “As of today we will not be adjusting our fares as we are busy completing a deeper study of driver economics in light of the concerns and feedback that we have received from drivers to ensure that fares are correctly priced,” a spokesperson for Uber Technologies said in an email to Reuters. The Digital Taxi Association of Kenya, representing more than 2,000 ride hailing taxi drivers, signed a deal on Wednesday meant to give drivers higher pay and better conditions. The drivers said they thought the deal would cushion them in the event of falling fares arising from discounts companies offers to passengers. They had staged a nine-day strike seeking higher fares and better working conditions. As in other markets, these ride hailing services in Kenya initially faced opposition and sometimes hostility from other taxi drivers.  Kenya is Uber’s second-largest market in sub-Saharan Africa, after South Africa. It competes mostly against its local rival Taxify, which has gained popularity in Nairobi in the past year and a half but does not disclose numbers of active riders and users.
