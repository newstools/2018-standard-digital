The State-owned insurer recorded a Sh10 billion increase in revenue to Sh47.8 billion from Sh37.1 billion the previous year. While membership contribution increased to Sh32.9 billion from Sh29.8 billion, premiums from special medical schemes increased by Sh7 billion to Sh12 billion in 2017/18. The biggest portion, however, of the average Sh34 billion bills paid in the year ending June 2018 was on free maternal programme. According to the unaudited financial results by the NHIF for 2017/18, while the free maternal programme payouts to beneficiaries went up to Sh1.4 billion, the usual maternal services payouts went down by six per cent to Sh1.5 billion from Sh1.6 billion.

Court clears Sh836m cover for civil servants The increase can be attributed to the Linda Mama programme included into NHIF last year after its launch in 2016. The programme in its first financial year was managed directly by the government, not under NHIF, before it was incorporated into the basic insurance scheme. The programme provides free maternal services for all expectant women, including those aged below 18. One also does not need to be a member of NHIF to benefit, unlike the usual maternal services where one has to be a beneficiary or contributor to the scheme to benefit. The reduction in payouts for maternal services and increase in free maternal payouts means most women prefer to access the free services compared to using their NHIF cards. It is such programmes and increased payments that NHIF is banking on to declare itself ready and fit for the roll out of the Universal Health Coverage (UHC) next month. In the 11-page document titled ‘Strides towards UHC coverage for all Kenyans’ that contains the latest financial statement, NHIFoutlines its readiness for the Big Four agenda. “The expanded benefits package currently offered has increased healthcare access for NHIF members and at the same time boosted the health care providers ability to provide more effective care to both NHIFmembers and the Kenyan citizen,” reads the document.
