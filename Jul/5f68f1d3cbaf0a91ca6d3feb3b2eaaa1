Kiminini MP Chris Wamalwa (pictured) has clashed with former nominated senator Zipporah Kittony over Governor Patrick Khaemba's succession. During a church function last weekend, Ms Kittony accused Mr Wamalwa of launching premature campaigns for the governor's seat, arguing that this was distracting Khaemba's leadership. "Let's give governor Khaemba ample time to finish his term to deliver services,” said Ms Kittony. But Wamalwa said he had every right to campaign for the seat and that he was keen to succeed Khaemba. “I'm not interfering with the leadership of the county, this is why the governor has not complained,” said the MP.
