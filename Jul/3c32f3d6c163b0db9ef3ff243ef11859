She further said that in their wholesale outlets they had resulted not to sell the commodity in bulk. The manager attributed the shortages to the government’s tough clamping on imported “bad” sugar and what she termed as politics in the whole issue. The only available sugar in the supermarket was the Ndhiwa sugar brand with price tags of Sh129 per kilo. ALSO READ:
