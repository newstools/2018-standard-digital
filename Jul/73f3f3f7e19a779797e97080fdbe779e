A 43-year-old man is trekking across the East African region on a mission to preach peace and coexistence. Caliph Kauso Mulwa has covered more than 300km from Nairobi and was yesterday in Eldoret on his way to Bujumbura, Burundi. Mulwa is using his walk to raise funds to establish three schools in remembrance of three children who died during the 2017 election. Speaking in Eldoret yesterday, Mulwa said he intended to raise Sh16 million after covering 1,600 kilometres. He urged organisations to help construct the schools for persons with disabilities in remembrance of the three children allegedly killed by police after the elections. He said nine-year-old Stephanie Moraah, who was shot dead while on a balcony in Mathare, six-month-old baby Samantha Pendo, whose head was hit with a baton in Kisumu, and Stephen Mutinda, who was shot dead in Nairobi's Pipeline Estate while playing on a balcony, are the focus of the walk dubbed ‘The Great Trek’. “My mission is to ensure the three children are not forgotten. The schools will be built in their regions through the permission of their parents so as to act as a reminder that peace is everything,” he said. Know if news is factual and true.
