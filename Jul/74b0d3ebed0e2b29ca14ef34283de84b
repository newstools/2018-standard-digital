The Nairobi City County Government has began repossessing public toilets from traders who were charging residents for their use. Following Governor Mike Sonko’s declaration last week that use of the toilets is free, City Hall yesterday published a notice asking all handlers to surrender the facilities to the county before a viable contractor is identified to take over operations.

It was signed by Chief Officer Environment, David Makori and addressed to one of the handlers. “To this effect henceforth, public toilets will be manged by the Nairobi City County Government,” it added.

There are currently 62 public toilets in Nairobi which are managed through the public-private partnership but that is set to change soon. The facilities rake in approximately Sh1.2 million each month translating to Sh14.8 million a year and the move to scrap the fees will deny City Hall the much-needed revenue. The Environment department, however, says that not all handlers pay the fees because some don't have valid licenses. ALSO READ:
