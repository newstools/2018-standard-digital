Original rate Base Titanium agreed to revise the royalty rate and negotiations were entered into in February 2014.  The firm proposed a formula for doubling the rate to five per cent for the first five years of operation, but with a deferral mechanism for the first three years to protect cash flows necessary to service its Sh20 billion debt. The offer was tabled in September 2014, but Base said it had not received approval from the Mining ministry and, therefore, continues to pay royalties at the original rate of 2.5 per cent. In the last quarter, the mining firm has reduced its debt exposure by Sh2.7 billion which puts its overall loan at Sh3.3 billion. Mr Wall said given their past record, they are set to clear the debt by the end of the year. ALSO READ:
