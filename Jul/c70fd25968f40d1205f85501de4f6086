Charms are popular in Nigeria, where traditional healers are consulted for cures for various ailments. But there have been several reports of people being killed after testing "bullet-proof" charms and medicines. "A young man had gone to [the healer] to prepare bullet-proof charms for him, which the native doctor did," a villager told the Punch newspaper.  "To prove the efficacy of the new charms, [he] positioned and handed over a gun to his customer. Tragedy struck." In January, a traditional medicine seller was arrested after a man drank a "bullet-repelling" liquid and was shot dead. The seller in north-western Nigeria reportedly assured the man that he could not die if he was shot. ALSO READ:
