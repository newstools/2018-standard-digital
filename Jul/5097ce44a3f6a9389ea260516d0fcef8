Cotu Secretary-General Francis Atwoli led the union team. The deliberations covered a wide array of aspects needed to lower the cost of housing in the country, including the escalating cost of land, provision of supporting infrastructure, anchor legislation and financing among other key considerations. Speaking at the meeting, Uhuru urged the leaders to engage actively with the programme with a view to making it better because Kenyans deserve good quality and affordable houses.
