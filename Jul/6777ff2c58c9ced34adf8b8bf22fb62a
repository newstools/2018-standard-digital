Ward reps get Sh700m more for development On Friday, County Finance Minister Nerry Achar said they will henceforth use a cashless system. But he was quick to assure casual workers contracted to collect revenues for the county that once the new system picks up, they will be re-absorbed in the system. He clarified that only 100 revenue workers whose contracts had expired, were terminated from service but none of them was dismissed as was recently reported. ''This is expected to bridge the budget deficit. It will also see us raise allocation to wards from Sh30 to Sh200 million,'' he said at a press conference. Currently, Kisumu County's budget is Sh9.2 billion, down from the initial Sh9.6 billion, which could not be realised due to shortfalls in revenue targets. Avoid fake news!
