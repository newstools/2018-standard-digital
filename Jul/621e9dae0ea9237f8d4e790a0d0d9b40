The KDDC law seeks to establish a legal backing for the dairy value-addition chain, and will also give way to the establishing of a corporation to coordinate activities in the sector. “We cannot expect to make progress if over-reliance on sugarcane farming is allowed to continue," said Mr Oparanya.
