Kirinyaga Governor Anne Waiguru has moved to improve trade in the county through the construction of new markets and upgrading of dilapidated ones. Already at least five markets are under construction including Wang’uru, Ngurubani, Kagumo, Kiamutugu and Kagio in a move that will expand trade and move the county towards a 24-hour economy. According to Governor Waiguru, the projects are aimed at improving trade and business in the county and ensuring job creation and sustainability – a key pillar in her Mountain Cities Blueprint. “Our plan is to provide ample space and conditions for traders to carry out their business and by building new markets, and upgrading existing ones, we are not only improving trade for existing traders but also providing an opportunity for farmers in different parts of the county to access markets and sell their produce.” “We are complementing these efforts by upgrading and expanding our roads to open up remote parts of the county and ensure easy and faster movement of goods to markets.” The programme includes constructing of new markets, erecting streetlights, setting up abolition blocks nears market centres, and constructing and expanding parking spaces.
