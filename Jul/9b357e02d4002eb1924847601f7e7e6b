Zimbabwe rivals both say on course for election victory President Emmerson Mnangagwa said his ruling ZANU-PF party was receiving "extremely positive" data, while opposition leader Nelson Chamisa said the MDC party was "winning resoundingly". The claims pointed to a contested result in the historic election, raising the prospect of competing fraud allegations and a possible run-off vote in September -- required if no candidate wins at least 50 percent of ballots in the first round. ZANU-PF has held an iron grip on power in Zimbabwe since independence from British colonial rule in 1980, and victory for the opposition would be a major upset.

Zimbabwe's Chamisa says has done exceedingly well Early results from the elections -- presidential, parliamentary and local -- are expected Tuesday, and full results are due by Saturday. At one polling station in the capital Harare, officials counted large piles of ballots using gas lanterns and candles late into the night on Monday. If required, Zimbabwe's 5.6 million registered voters would be asked to return to the polls to vote in a presidential run-off on September 8. But Mnangagwa, 75, Mugabe's former right-hand man, was confident of an outright first-round win. "The information from our reps on the ground is extremely positive! Waiting patiently for official results as per the constitution," Mnangagwa said on Twitter. Chamisa, 40, who raised allegations of voter fraud repeatedly during the campaign, was equally buoyant, saying that his MDC was ready to form the next government. "Winning resoundingly... We've done exceedingly well," he said on Twitter. ALSO READ:
