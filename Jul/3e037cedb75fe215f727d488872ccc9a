Obado, Ayacko rivalry divides ODM ahead of bruising battle Solomon Hodo and Kennedy Makasembo yesterday announced they are set for face-off with ODM nominee Ochillo Ayacko in the October 8 by-election. "I have consulted my people and resolved to go it solo," said Mr Hodo. Mr Makasembo, a former Kenya Union of Post-Primary Education Teachers official, expressed similar sentiments. "Let the people decide on October 8. The ballot is my last stop," Makasembo told The Standard.  Another aspirant, Eddy Oketch, said he was still consulting. "I will make my stand known this week." The two candidates could soon be joined by former Cabinet minister Dalmas Otieno. The former minister has expressed his intent to vie despite not having a party. "I am still shopping for a party. I am almost getting one so that I can launch my campaigns by latest next week," said Mr Otieno. Former MPs John Pesa and Edick Anyanga, who had earlier thrown their hats into the ring, have curiously gone quiet. Two family members of the late Senator Ben Oluoch, Mark Okundi and the deceased's son Willis Okello, are also yet to declare their stance. ALSO READ:

Trouble in ODM as Obado rejects Ayacko’s direct nomination But despite all the posturing, sources intimated that some of the aspirants  contemplated abiding with ODM's decision for the sake of peace, and also not to be seen to be defying the party leaders.

Hodo and Makasembo said they had notified the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission of their intention to go it alone. Yesterday, ODM Director of Elections Junet Mohammed, Director of Political Affairs Opiyo Wandayi and chairman John Mbadi cautioned Obado against opposing the party's choice.
