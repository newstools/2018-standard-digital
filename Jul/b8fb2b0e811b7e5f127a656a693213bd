NAIROBI, KENYA: Chief Justice David Maraga on Tuesday said budget cut in the current financial year is likely to affect operations of the Judiciary with the ongoing projects across the country stalling. Speaking in Nairobi, Maraga said the Judiciary requested for Sh31.2 billion to support its operation in the 2018/19 financial year but ended up with Sh14.5 billion which is not enough to implement most of the projects.

This means that the 41 government funded projects which are at various stages will stall. These are Homabay, Kabarnet, Marsabit, Amagoro, Kandara, Machakos, Supreme COURT, Kiambu law Courts, Embu, Mandera, narok,Eldoret, Othaya, Bomet, Garsen,Mombasa, Kitale, Neri, Maseno and Makadara. Out of the Sh31.2 billion Judiciary requested, Sh19.8billion was to be set aside for recurrent budget while development and resource requirement were to take Sh11.4 billion and Sh891 million respectively.
