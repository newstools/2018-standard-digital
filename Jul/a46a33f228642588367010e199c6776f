Members of the County Assembly have been signing the attendance register for their absent colleagues to get sitting allowances. The findings are contained in an Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission (EACC) report on corruption risk assessment into the systems, policies, procedures and practices of the county assembly, which was released last week and presented to County Assembly Clerk Michael Ngala.

Governor Ngilu’s nominees rejected in row with MCAs The report noted that a review of the attendance registers for the Health Committee dated October 31 and November 7 last year showed that signatures for one member were different. “MCAs signed for each other because the attendance registers have different signatures. The attendance registers were not closed immediately at the end of the meetings by the Committee Services Units,” read part of the risk assessment report published last Thursday. Specimen signatures According to the report, which was presented by EACC Commissioner Dabar Abdi and Deputy Director, Prevention Services, Emily Chege, the county assembly did not maintain specimen signatures for the MCAs for purposes of examining the registers, which are used as supporting documents during payment of sitting allowances.

The EACC noted that failure to ensure the integrity of the registers created a loophole for paying undeserving MCAs therefore resulting in the loss of public funds. The EACC team noted that notification for meetings was not done in writing prior to the events, in contravention of the Standing Orders. It was also revealed that the assembly did not have sufficient equipment for recording and transcribing plenary and committee proceedings. The report said installed equipment often broke down, occasioning the loss of records of proceedings. ALSO READ:
