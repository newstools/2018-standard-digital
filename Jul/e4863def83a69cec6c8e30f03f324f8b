The system, which operates like a mobile wallet, will receive money and allow suppliers to draw their payments in real time, according to the company’s chief executive, Mohamed Mohamed. ALSO READ:

Text the word 'NEWS' to 22840 Mohamed said the model could not work due to procurement processes and sub-optimal sales, which meant that the retailer could not run operations on the 20 per cent it was to earn. “Only about 30 per cent of the suppliers agreed to the escrow and they set a credit limit so you found that you could not sell optimal stock to cover costs and still pay on time,” Mohamed said. The firm, which has closed several branches, says it has now cut costs and will further reduce expenses through the franchise model. “If we can manage half of the branches on franchise and the other directly we can significantly reduce costs and boost sales,” Mohamed said.
