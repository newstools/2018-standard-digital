Cut links with Raila, Ford Kenya leaders tell Wetangula Kalonzo, who was addressing a conference on mediation themed “Mediation for Development” at Strathmore University in Nairobi on Thursday said Kenyans are tired of combative politics and are yearning for politics of tolerance. “Looking at the papers today, I saw firebrand politics. I think Kenyans are getting tired of that type of politics. We lose the God-given virtue of tolerance by not listening to each other,” said Kalonzo. Kalonzo cautioned leaders against what he termed ‘fireworks politics’ adding that contrary to reports, NASA is not on its deathbed. He also challenged Parliament to make laws that firmly entrench mediation into the Constitution of Kenya.  “Both the National Assembly and the Senate should take it upon themselves to come up with legislation which is anchored on the very Constitution itself. We are not doing anything out of the rule of law,” he said. On corruption, the Wiper leader reiterated his call on President Uhuru Kenyatta not to relent in the current war against corruption. “If President Uhuru Kenyatta blinks on this fight against corruption, we will have lost it. If he doesn’t blink, I will give him a big hug myself.” Speaking at the same forum, Chief Justice David Maraga implored Kenyans to embrace mediation rather than litigation, saying the former has proven to be cost effective and less time consuming.
