Part of the agreement was that the county budgets for the equipping of all its health centres with the necessary workforce and equipment. The high number of patients going to KNH, which is meant to be a referral facility, has been blamed on the break-down of devolved health care system.

Some of the health centres targeted are in informal settlements like Korogocho, Mathare and Kariobangi. “We have given ourselves three years to make sure KNH is decongested so that people do not have to queue at the hospital for a service they can easily get within their locality,” said Kioko. The push to decongest KNH was initiated by Health Cabinet Secretary Sicily Kariuki, who described it as her very first assignment after taking office early in the year. She launched a team to come up with recommendations. ALSO READ:
