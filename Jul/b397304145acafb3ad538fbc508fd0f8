Women circumcisers to cut garments, not girls County Commissioner Isaiah Nakoru told the Advisory Council on Children Rights that the Government would start profiling retired female medics alongside those working in rural health facilities, whom he said were the main culprits. The forum, which was also attended by area children's officers, leaders of non-State players engaged in campaigns against FGM, and administrators, heard that the rite was still prevalent. Adventist Relief Agency, an active non-government organisation involved in eradicating FGM in South Nyanza and other parts of the country, noted that the outlawed rite of passage remained high in parts of Kuria, Kisii and Nyamira. Adra-Kenya Regional Manager Mary Kwamboka said the organisation had rescued about 10,000 girls.
