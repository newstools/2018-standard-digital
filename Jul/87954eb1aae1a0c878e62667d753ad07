Sports Minister Rashid Echesa told the BBC he had authorised only six MPs to travel, to help understand how to organise such big events. Kenya have never qualified for a World Cup final and are currently ranked 112 out of 206 nations by football's world governing body, Fifa. However, Kenya is one of the world's most successful athletics nations and has submitted a bid to host the 2023 World Athletics Championships.  But many Kenyans thought the trip was a waste of money in a country where the average person lives on $150 (Â£113) a month. But Senate Clerk Jeremiah Nyegenye, who is head of the Parliamentary Service Commission that determines the responsibilities and remuneration of legislators, said the trip was worthwhile. A parliamentary source has told the BBC that members of parliament usually travel first class. When travelling on official business, Kenyan MPs are entitled to daily allowances for expenses of around $1,000. ALSO READ:
