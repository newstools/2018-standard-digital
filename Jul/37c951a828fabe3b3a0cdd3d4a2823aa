Initially, Cheluget had said Mr Gwako had no right to bury her daughter because he had not paid pride price. This prompted Gwako to go to court to seek orders to allow him to bury his wife. High Court judge David Majanja recognised Gwako as the husband of the 30-year-old Chepng’eno and granted him the right to bury her. Gwako, a prison warder based in Kisii, has asked wellwishers to help him raise Sh600,000 to pay the mortuary fees. His wife, also a prison warder based in Garissa, died on June 10 last year at a Kisii hospital after developing complications during childbirth. Cheluget said she was unhappy that Gwako had turned to social media to try to raise funds for the burial.
