The French company supplied the Sh3.8 billion Kenya Integrated Election Management System (KIEMS) kits used to identify voters. According to Safran, the claims by NASA leaders were lies that hurt its reputation. The firm had said its business to supply security and identity gadgets in the country and abroad was in jeopardy out of the claims by the three leaders. But the opposition leaders in their separate replies denied defaming the company. In his reply, Raila denied authoring a letter said to have been sent to the French government calling for the company’s head of the Kenyan project, Laurent Lambert, and head of analytics, Axel Gaucher, to be punished. Raila argued that sentiments on rigging emanated from a Supreme Court’s judgement. Kalonzo and Mudavadi fronted a similar defence.
