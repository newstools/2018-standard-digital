Once again, Kenya has been selected to host a global event. It’s good news Nairobi was picked to host the 2020 IAAF World Athletics Under-20 championships. The International Association of Athletics Federations endorsed Nairobi’s candidacy at the IAAF Council in Buenos Aires, Argentina on Thursday. After hosting an outstanding final edition of the IAAF World U18 championships last year, Nairobi demonstrated readiness to take the next step as a host hence the reason it was awarded the rights for the U20 championships.

Toronto Waterfront Marathon: ‘Baby Police’ Rono aims for third Toronto title The crowds of up to 60,000 that attended the U18 championships at Nairobi’s Moi International Sports Centre created an exciting atmosphere and the world is once again ready to see what we can offer. Congratulations to Athletics Kenya (AK) for bringing athletics home once again, but work must start now. While we should bask in the glory that we will once again host the world in Nairobi, we have an even tougher task to impress the world more. We will also be the first country in Africa to host the U20 event and we should not let down the global sports fraternity for the faith they showed in us.
Good preparation will ensure we host one of the best events, even much better than the U18 and who knows we could consider bidding for the World Athletics Championships? Over to the AK and the Local Organising Committee to put up a very successful championship.  Stay informed while on the go by subscribing to the Standard Group SMS service.
