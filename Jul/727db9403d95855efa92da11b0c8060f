Black spots  Speaking at Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital (MTRH) on Monday after visiting four accident victims at the facility, the MP said: “We have been in talks with MTRH Chief Executive Officer Dr Wilson Aruasa on the need to establish the facility between Kapkoi, Bayete and Kerita, which is one of the accident black spots. We want to set up the facility on a five-acre piece of land”. Although he did not mention the cost and when the project would commence, Dr Mishra stated that the facility would have an Intensive Care Unit with six bed capacity, along with 10 beds for High Dependency Unit, one theater and two ambulances. He said that would enable quick administration of lifesaving treatment, especially with the existence of critical care staff. He said MTRH had agreed to provide personnel stationed at the facility once it was set up. ALSO READ:
