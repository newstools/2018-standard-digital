A postmortem examination conducted by Dr Scholastica Kimani at the Meru Level Five Hospital revealed that Mwenda had sustained injuries on his head and private parts. Family lawyer Igeweta Murithi, who had been assigned by Independent Medico-Legal Unit, witnessed the two-hour examination of the boy's body.  It is alleged that Mwenda was tortured while in custody at Kiraone AP Post on June 6. He succumbed to the injuries on June 12 while undergoing treatment at Chaaria Mission Hospital in Imenti Central. Mwenda was arrested on suspicion of stealing Sh20,000 from a relative. Igembe South police boss Rashid Mohammed said they had opened an inquiry file to document accounts of witnesses before taking action. ALSO READ:
