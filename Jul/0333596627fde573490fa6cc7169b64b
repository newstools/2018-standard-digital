While we welcome the Government’s concerted action on illicit trade, this principally addresses counterfeit goods, which is only a small part of a much wider problem in relation to cigarettes,” said BAT’s Managing Director Ms Beverley Spencer-Obatoyinbo. Ms Spencer also explained that as the second half of the year starts, the company remains bullish of improved performance despite the strict regulatory environment.
