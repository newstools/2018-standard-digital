How telecom's mast changed lives in Baragoi “It was very surprising, at first I thought I was getting pranked, because who wins a house?” exclaimed Mr Lindenberg visibly exited. However, the call was soon verified when music from the approaching caravan grew louder as comedian Chipukeezy led a bevy of dancers and a camera crew scanning the crowd for a still-perturbed Lindenberg. Lindenberg is the second winner of a two bed-roomed apartment at the serene Richard Point Apartments off Kamiti Road. This is following last week’s win by Mr James Njagi, a juakali artisan based in Nairobi’s Gikomba market.  Lindenberg has lived in Kenya for six years working as a designer and was introduced to M-Pesa after a friend made a transaction he found intriguing. “I remember when I saw my friend withdraw money from an ATM without having an ATM card straight from his phone through M-Pesa,” he explains. “It was the first time I was seeing anyone do that and I found that to be very intriguing.” Lindenberg said he uses M-Pesa frequently to manage his payroll and make payments to his employees. He has a wife and two children and has not yet decided what he will do with the house. ALSO READ:
