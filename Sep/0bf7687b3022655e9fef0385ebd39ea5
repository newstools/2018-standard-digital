Narok Senator Ledama ole Kina has claimed issues surrounding incitement accusations levelled against him are a distraction on the government’s main agenda to evict people from Mau Forest.
 
The Senator’s sentiments comes after a section of Rift Valley MPs accused him of inciting residents in Mau clashes.
 
“All the shenanigans about incitement are nothing but a red herring. We are focused, the government has a project of evicting everyone out of the Mau forest and I support the government fully,” he said.
 
He added that the side shows would not prevent him from performing his duty as senator of Narok County.
 
“The constitution mandates me as the senator to protect the county and its people. The water catchment area is important not only for the people of Narok but also for the people of this country,” said Ledama.
 
The senator was speaking during the first Senate sitting outside parliament in Eldoret. The sitting comes to an end today with Senate Speaker Ken Lusaka saying it has been successful.
 
Senator Ledama has been under fire from six Rift Valley MP’s including Joshua Kutuny (Cherengany), Hilary Kosgei (Kipkelion West), Nelson Koech (Belgut), Dominic Koskei (Sotik), Brighton Yegon (Konoin) and Sammy Serona (nominated).
 
The MPs claim Ledama, two months ago at a rally in Nkaretha threatened to take unspecified action if non-indigenous people do not leave Mau.
 
"I want to call on the DPP Noordin Haji and IG Joseph Boinnet to arrest and prosecute Narok Senator Ledama Ole Kina and other Maa leaders over their inflammatory and reckless statements that led to the violence," said Kutuny.
 
On September 27, 2018 Senator Ledama was summoned to appear before the Narok County Security Team and Intelligence officers on Monday at 10 am. ALSO READ:
