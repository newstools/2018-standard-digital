Tanzania’s biggest Telco, Vodacom has appointed Hisham Hendi as its acting Managing Director awaiting the recently appointed Sylvia Mulinge to resolve her work permit related issues. “Mr Hisham Hendi has assumed the role of acting managing director from September 1, 2018 until such time the on-boarding process of the substantive managing director is completed,” said Vodacom Tanzania. Sylvia Mulinge was named Vodacom Tanzania MD five months ago after the position was left vacant following the exit of Ian Ferrao, a Briton who saw the telco listed in the country’s stock exchange in 2017. However, the government of Tanzania is yet to clear Mulinge’s work permit issues in what is believed to be a non-issue by the Immigration department. “They have not given us any negative feedback and neither have they confirmed. They just told us to wait as they follow the process,” said Mulinge. The Tanzania High Commission stipulates that foreigners seeking to work for companies or institutions in the country should obtain Class B Residence Work Permit. “So far we have received no feedback, so we do not know the possible outcome. Work permit applications and their approval time periods vary,” said Vodacom Tanzania Chairman Ali Mufuruki . Avoid fake news!
