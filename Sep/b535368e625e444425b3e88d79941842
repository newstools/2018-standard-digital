But more than two years since it was begun, the project remains unfinished and the contractor has left the site. The county assembly's Implementation committee chaired by Nambuku/Namboboto MCA Vincent Olumbe yesterday visited the site to ascertain the status of the project. Mr Olumbe said the contractor had already been paid Sh31 million before the project stalled. The committee wondered why the county director of works and structural engineer, who were supervising the project, allowed the contractor to be paid 70 per cent of the total cost before completing the work.

The committee demanded the project's design, bills of quantities and certificate of payments, and warned other contractors whose projects had stalled that they would be investigated. “It is not going to be business as usual, even if it means seeking assistance from the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission.” Deputy Governor Moses Mulomi said the maternity wing must be completed to ease congestion at the hospital.
