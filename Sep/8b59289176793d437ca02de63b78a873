MPs plan protests over the new taxation "The reason why government wants tax is so that the poor gets fees through primary, electricity, and roads," said the DP. 
At the same time, he has warned unscrupulous traders against increasing prices of commodities on pretext of the tax increase. 
"Those using the tax to exploit Kenyans should be ashamed of themselves. Some even increase prices on products that are not even related to fuel. This is conmanship and should stop," warned DP. DP also warned public service vehicles of risking losing their licences should they be found to be increasing prices against the law. "I have talked with the NTSA to ensure that all matatu saccos who increase the fuel are banned from operating. We cannot afford to have people who increase fare oppressing the poor just for selfish gain, "said DP. The DP said the government is undertaking over 300km of roads worth over Sh15 billion in Narok among them, Narok-Sekenani, Kisirir-Mau Narok roads under construction.
