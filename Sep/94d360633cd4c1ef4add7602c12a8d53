But Mr Koskei insisted that the Narok MPs were to blame for the clashes. “These clashes are political, instigated by known political leaders who should face the law. I do not know why the Government is taking so long to take action,” he said. On Saturday, fears that the clashes would flare up again were rife after unknown people attacked Olposimoru in Narok North. ALSO READ:
