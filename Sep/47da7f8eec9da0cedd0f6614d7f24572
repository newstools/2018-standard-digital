Gay sex had been punishable by up to 10 years in jail. Activists welcomed the ruling. “Thanks to all that fought for this, braving the worst sort of prejudice.

A law known as “Section 377” had prohibited “carnal intercourse against the order of nature with any man, woman or animal” - which was widely interpreted to refer to homosexual sex. ALSO READ:
