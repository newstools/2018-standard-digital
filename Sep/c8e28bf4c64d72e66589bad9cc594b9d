  The National Assembly Powers and Privileges Committee has summoned MPs to shed light on bribery claims during the preparation of the report on importation of illegal and contaminated sugar. In a communication from Speaker Justin Muturi, the committee said it would invite a number of MPs as it seeks to get to the bottom the matter. ALSO READ:

Rotich's options in the tough times Muturi said among the members of interest to the committee in its inquiry are Kimilili MP Didmus Barasa and his Muhoroni counterpart Onyango K'Oyoo, who had made the bribery claims. The two are also members of that committee. "As a principle of law, you cannot wear the hat of a judge on a matter in which you are appearing as a witness," he said. The speaker said he had singled out the two lawmakers to appear on September 18. Muturi said more MPs who had publicly admitted witnessing their colleagues being bribed to shoot down the report will be called upon to share more information on the matter. “A number of MPs are or may be required to appear before the committee as whistle blowers to assist the Committee to get to the bottom of those grave allegations of bribery in the House,” he said.

The speaker warned MPs that they took an oath "faithfully and conscientiously" to discharge the duties of the House. He said the oversight function of the House as carried out through the committees elevates it to a status akin to that of a High Court. “The exercise of this unique quasi-judicial function is expected to strictly adhere to and apply the principles of natural justice and fair hearing, and that every process or action taken by the House or its Committees must be seen by all to be above board, taking into account the fact that decisions of this House bear the element of finality,” he said.
