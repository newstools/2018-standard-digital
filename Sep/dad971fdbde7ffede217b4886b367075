Molo police boss Mr Bernard Kioko said Ndirangu was burning charcoal in his homestead on Wednesday evening before he left for a drinking spree. At around 7.30pm, he is alleged to have returned home while drunk before picking a quarrel with his wife over a petty family issue. Kioko said surprisingly, instead of resolving the dispute, Ndirangu picked their three-year-old boy who was asleep inside the main house, and threw him in the burning furnace which was outside the homestead. “The deceased went to a drinking spree and when he got back home, he quarrelled with his wife.  He would later throw their child who was asleep in a burning furnace,” said Kioko.
