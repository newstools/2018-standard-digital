Kenyans on social media on Thursday reacted negatively to the new blue police uniforms design and colour. Majority expressed their dislike and criticised the new uniforms describing them as horrible and ugly. ALSO READ:

Planned police changes ‘to boost security, save money’ The reactions, using the trending hashtag #PoliceReforms included hilarious posts, which associated the new police uniforms features like big pockets that could be used to stash bribery money among others uses. Some also used the hashtag to instead demand good housing conditions for the police, saying police reforms should not be new uniforms. @Asmali77 tweeted: The #PoliceReforms also increased the pocket sizes for the police uniform. ‏@ClaretAdhiambo: Hope the new Kenya Police uniforms have no pockets #policereforms #goteana. @leemakwiny: Police reforms cannot be possible with that ugly uniform. Police reforms are not uniform. We must retain the old uniform. It’s good. #PoliceReforms Stay informed while on the go by subscribing to the Standard Group SMS service.

They look like Salvation Army Band ... Police Uniform must be one that shows fitness & inspires fear ... Here, we were conned ... #PoliceReforms . @FidelFidel6: Retweet this if you hate the new police uniform for Kenya Police #PoliceReforms. Some posted photos of a Chinese female blue uniformed officer together with the new Kenyan police officers saying we have copied the colour and loaned them from China. I am told the new Kenya Police uniforms are part of the Chinese Loans. Next President Uhuru Kenyatta will paint our officers yellow to complete the transformation of Kenya Zing Chu police!#PoliceReforms pic.twitter.com/1GIw2qwEMq

Or maybe we lacked a tender to offer the "master" forcing us to buy police uniform from them?!  Or is our police service collateral for another loan! #PoliceReforms. To Marcello Omuttaha, who posted a picture of the Rwandan police officers next to Kenyan, we went wrong on design of the uniforms.
