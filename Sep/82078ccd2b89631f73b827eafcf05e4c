Journalists arrested over alleged theft Recounting the Sunday night incident from his hospital bed yesterday, Mr Kinyua said they were rounded up by the heavily armed gang. “The gang conducted roll-call for the five of us but a sixth colleague disappeared, resulting in a thorough beating before they stripped us naked," he said, adding that the missing guard set off the alarm, prompting the thieves to flee. At the Gatuto factory, Isaac Gatimu, 72, was struck on the head with a blunt object and left unconscious. His colleague managed to escape unhurt and the thieves left empty handed. Central Regional Commissioner Wilson Njega said security agents were pursuing the suspects, adding that they included millers in the area. “We are concerned about the rampant theft of coffee beans in the region and I am assuring farmers the cartels involved will soon be dismantled," he said.
