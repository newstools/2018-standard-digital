  Leaders from western Kenya have criticised Amani National Congress (ANC) leader Musalia Mudavadi for the party's threat to discipline MCAs who visited Deputy President William Ruto a fortnight ago. Senate Speaker Kenneth Lusaka, Hamisi MP Charles Gimose, Vihiga Deputy Governor Patrick Saisi and MCAs from Vihiga and Kakamega said it was not proper to restrict leaders from meeting the deputy president.

Victimising the MCAs is retrogressive,” Mr Lusaka said. The leaders spoke at Hamisi grounds in Hamisi constituency on Friday during a funds drive to help Hamulel Women Group to purchase a bus. ANC members at the Vihiga County assembly have said they would defy the plan to punish them for visiting the DP. On Thursday, a plot by some MCAs to remove the county assembly's deputy speaker, Nixon Butiya, and the majority chief whip, Victor Ijaika, failed. The two were among those who visited Mr Ruto at his Karen home.
