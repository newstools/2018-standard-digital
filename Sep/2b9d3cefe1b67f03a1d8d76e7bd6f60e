  Two women leaders have demanded the arrest of a top official at the Embu Level Five Hospital over assault allegations. County Assembly Majority Chief Whip Maggie Lorna Kariuki and local Maendeleo Ya Wanawake chairperson Maureen Nyaga threatened to call a mass action if Governor Martin Wambora did not take action against the hospital's CEO Moses Njue over the claims.

The calls came days after Mary Njoroge, a consultant, claimed Dr Njue struck her last Thursday. Dr Njoroge recorded a statement at a local police station and wrote to the County Secretary and Health Chief Officer demanding action against Njue. But Njue, a former chief government pathologist, denied the allegations and accused Njoroge of malice. He claimed doctors were fighting him for introducing tough measures to stem lateness and absenteeism. Avoid becoming a victim of Fake News.

The CEO said on the said day, Njoroge and other doctors reported late to work and all he did was ask them why they had kept patients waiting, some from as early as 6am. He challenged Njoroge to prove that he assaulted her. “Dr Njue was verbally and physically aggressive towards me and struck me in the face. This was traumatic and embarrassing and affected my ability to perform my duties,” said Njoroge. ALSO READ:
