Ugandan police have handed over two Kenyans suspected to have caused the death of a man who was allegedly pushed out of a speeding bus. Twenty-six-year-old Robert Warinda died when he fell off the bus at Migaa on the Nakuru-Eldoret highway on August 14. The two suspects have been in the custody of Ugandan police in Kampala since early this month, when they were arrested after the family of the deceased reported the matter to the Ugandan authorities.
