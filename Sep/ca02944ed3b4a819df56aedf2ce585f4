  Nine Amani National Congress MCAs have dared the party to expel them for visiting Deputy President William Ruto.

Addressing the media yesterday in Kakamega town, the MCAs, led by the Isukha South representative, Farouk Machanje (pictured), said there was no clause in the ANC constitution that prohibited them from meeting other leaders. Mr Machanje said the ward reps were ready to face the consequences for meeting with Mr Ruto, adding that nothing would stop them from meeting leaders from competing political parties. “Going to meet the deputy president doesn’t mean that I have shifted my allegiance to the Jubilee Party,” he said. Machanje explained that the leaders went to see Ruto on his invitation to discuss development matters and not ways of scuttling Musalia Mudavadi’s 2022 presidential ambitions.
