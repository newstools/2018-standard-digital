NAIROBI, KENYA: Online fraudsters could be masquerading as e-commerce platforms, offering rock bottom prices for household goods as well as other goods and services to lure in unsuspecting Kenyans. This is according to the Communications Authority of Kenya (CA), which has warned of a rise in the number of conmen that have set up online shops as fronts and using them to steal from Kenyans. The tell-tale signs of such suspect operators include lack of basics that businesses should have including a physical address and customer care helpline. ALSO READ:
