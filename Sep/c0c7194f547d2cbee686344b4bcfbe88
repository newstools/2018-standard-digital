  Tension has gripped The Sacred Heart Girls High School Mukumu after a Form Two student died mysteriously in the dormitory. Regional DCI Commander David Cheruiyot said the student was taken to Kakamega General Hospital Mortuary Friday morning after she was confirmed dead by doctors. “It has been reported that the student had a general history of epilepsy, but the actual cause of the death is yet to be established,” said Mr Cheruiyot. The school’s principal, Fridah Ndolo, said Nathline Samantha had been sick and was on drugs before she finally succumbed to ‘a condition that was yet to be established’ on Thursday night. The principal did not, however, wish to divulge the kind of illness the student suffered from nor the type of drugs she had been taking. “She has been on drugs, but her condition was not intense to warrant admission to hospital care,” said Ms Ndolo, adding that forensic experts would identify what led to the girl’s death. She said Samantha had been fine the evening before her death. “Her friends say she took dinner whle sharing stories with them.” Stay informed while on the go by subscribing to the Standard Group SMS service.

The principal said she was later notified in the night that Samantha’s condition had worsened. “Her fellow students were woken up by a crack that appeared to come from her bed. When they went to confirm, they found her stiff and quiet on her bed, and immediately informed the matron,” she said. She added, “The matron informed me and I called a doctor from Mukumu Hospital who confirmed that the student had died.” The school notified the girl’s parents of their daughter’s demise.
