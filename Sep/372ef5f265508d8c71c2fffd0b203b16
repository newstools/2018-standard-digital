Uhuru to address UN General Assembly summit Isaac Okoth told The Standard that a conductor forced him to pay Sh250 after he could not raise Sh300 fare from Kisumu to Kakamega. "I was lured into the waiting Matatu by the same conductor who assured me the fare had dropped to the usual Sh200 only for him to change tune and start demanding more after the vehicle left the stage," he said. “The conductor wanted Sh300 which I refused to pay and after a long verbal altercation gave him Sh250. It is unfair to exploit your customer on stipulations that they are less informed,” said Mr. Okoth. Linda Neli, who was traveling to Nairobi from Kakamega said she had to part with Sh1200 up from the previous Sh1000. “When traveling normaly you can pay up to Sh1600, and that’s extravagant,” said Ms Neli.

He asserted that increment of fares was an inescapable misfortune dictated by the rules of business.
