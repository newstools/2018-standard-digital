The headcount was prompted by Controller of Budget Agnes Odhiambo, who had instructed the County Public Service Board to develop an optimal staffing structure. Ms Odhiambo also asked the county treasury to formulate strategies to streamline revenue collection because the county was not meeting its targets. A separate staff audit conducted earlier by the county government in collaboration with the Ministry of Devolution and National Planning made several recommendations, including sacking workers.
