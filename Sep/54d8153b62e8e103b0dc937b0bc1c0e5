ANC to punish nine MCAs for visiting DP Ruto Mr Mudavadi alleged the Government was hoodwinking Kenyans that the money was meant to fund the budget yet the reality was that it was meant to plug graft holes. He said over the past six years, the nation debt had more that tripled to Sh5.1 trillion, yet there was little to show for the borrowing which must be repaid anyway. “Now the chickens are coming home to roost. It's time to pay back and Jubilee Government does not know where to turn to or what to do, hence a punitive fuel levy that has been in cold storage for two years is now being imposed,” the ANC boss said. Speaking at the party offices in Lavington, Nairobi, yesterday, Mudavadi added: “I reiterate that the taxes are going to be used to pay for borrowings that have been stealthily stolen from public coffers by people in Government.” Consequently, Mudavadi called for investigations of officials mandated to manage institutions responsible for fuel.
