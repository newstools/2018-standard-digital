Sonko: Keep off my private life Suspended are: Hospital superintendent Dr. Catherine Mutinda, Dr. James Kamau the obstetrician gynecologist who was supposed to be on duty, hospital administator Zadock Angahya and the entire hospital board. Sonko who had paid an impromptu visit to the facility on a bodaboda found the bodies hidden in boxes at a corner. In jeans, military jacket and hat tightly pulled over the eyes in an apparent disguise, Sonko spread fear in the facility that is more often than not in the news for the wrong reasons. A video shows him losing his way in the hospital’s corridors with an official giving him directions in the background Sonko is heard asking “Shida iko pande gani? (What’s the problem here).” Stay informed while on the go by subscribing to the Standard Group SMS service. Text the word 'NEWS' to 22840. Someone then ushers him to walk straight along the corridor where he arrives at a station wrongly mispelt as Sister’s instead of Sisters. It is alleged that the hospital's management shut down the machines at the Maternity Wing. A fiery Sonko is also heard saying "Twende kwa hizo mashini hazifanyi kazi. (Show me the machines)." Some members of staff and patients are seen peeping from partially opened doors behind him. ALSO READ:
