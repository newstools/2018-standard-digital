NAIROBI, KENYA: Safaricom has re-appointed Sylvia Mulinge as the director in charge of special projects months after her appointment as the Managing Director of Vodacom Tanzania failed to take off. Before her appointment to the big position in Tanzania, she was the director for Safaricom’s consumer business unit. ALSO READ:

Safaricom appoints Nonini creative brand ambassador She joined Safaricom from Unilever in February 2006 and rose to the position of Director, Consumer Business. She is credited with, among other achievements, overseeing the growth of the telco’s enterprise business, spearheading regionalisation strategy and leveraging industry trends to deliver customer-focused products and services. Sylvia Mulinge was named Vodacom Tanzania MD five months ago after the position was left vacant following the exit of Ian Ferrao, a Briton who saw the telco listed in the country’s stock exchange in 2017. However, the government of Tanzania dragged in clearing her work permit in what was believed to be a non-issue by the Immigration department. She will now be the Safaricom's director of special projects as her re-appointment begins next week (October 1) and will be reporting directly to CEO Bob Collymore. Know if news is factual and true.
