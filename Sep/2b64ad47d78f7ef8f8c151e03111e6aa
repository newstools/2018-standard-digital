  The Kenya Medical Research Institute (Kemri) is developing herbal drugs to treat sexually transmitted infection (STIs). The chief research officer, Festus Tolo, said Kemri had engaged in ‘cutting edge’ research to improve human health using herbal medicine. "We have been carrying out studies on how to treat STIs such as herpes using traditional medicines," said Dr Tolo, who heads the Natural Products Research and Drug Development Programme. Tolo, who spoke at the Mombasa International Agricultural Society of Kenya Show yesterday, said Kemri had developed herbal creams to manage herpes.
