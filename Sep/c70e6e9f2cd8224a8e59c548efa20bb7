The nominee for County Executive Committee member for Health has called for construction of a level six hospital in the county. Zakayo Kariuki said Nakuru Level Five Hospital was handling work best done by a level six hospital. “The Nakuru Level Five Hospital is serving a population of more than 2.1 million people against the recommended 1 million. There is need for the county to upgrade one more facility to a level five hospital,” said Dr Kariuki (pictured) when he appeared before the County Appointments Committee for vetting. ALSO READ:

Kariuki, currently the Nyandarua County Health Director, suggested that Naivasha Level Four Hospital be upgraded to level five due to its location and population distribution. But even two level five hospitals, he said, cannot effectively address the demand for healthcare, as many other counties such as Nyandarua, Laikipia, Baringo, Bomet, Kericho and Narok also refer patients to Nakuru. To address this, Kariuki said the national Government should set up a level six hospital, similar to Kenyatta National Hospital and the Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital, in Nakuru to handle referrals from the town and neighbouring counties. “The county government has been left unfairly carrying the burden of other counties.” Avoid fake news!
