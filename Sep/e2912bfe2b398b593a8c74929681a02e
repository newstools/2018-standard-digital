Speaking during a public baraza at Kihongwe Mjini village yesterday, Lamu County Commissioner Joseph Kanyiri assured residents that the national and county governments were working with the investor for the best interests of the farmers who will pave the way for the project, adding that nobody would be victimised during the process.
