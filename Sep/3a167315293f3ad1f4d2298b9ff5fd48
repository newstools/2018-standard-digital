“My teacher ruined my future,” says defiled girl Resident Magistrate Eunice Kelly said the prosecution had substantiated the accused's guilt. “I have found prosecution evidence in record consistent and credible leaving no doubt in mind that the accused person committed the offence. I find him guilty and convict him accordingly,” said Ms Kelly. “I sentence you to life in prison as the offence you have committed is of first degree, cruel and serious,” she added. Mr Ndung’u - who teaches Standard Seven and Eight pupils - is said to have defiled the girl at his home in Mirangine on July 27, 2014. “My brother and I were delivering vegetables to the teacher’s house. My brother left the house and the teacher, who looked drunk, dragged me, took me to his room, undressed me, and defiled me. I screamed and a neighbour came to rescue me,” the victim said in her testimony. Stay informed while on the go by subscribing to the Standard Group SMS service. Text the word 'NEWS' to 22840.
