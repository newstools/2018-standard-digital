Man at epicentre of Sharon's murder mystery In a stripped blue-white shirt and grey jacket, Migori Governor Obado’s aide Michael Juma Oyamo was arraigned at the Homa Bay Law court in connection with the murder of Rongo University student Sharon Otieno. Oyamo had been held at the Homa Bay Police Station and appeared in court on Monday morning alongside eight other suspects. On Monday morning, the prosecution led by assistant Director of Public Prosecutions Tom Imbali asked for an extra 10 days to complete investigations adding that DNA samples were still being analysed. Oyamo's lawyers opposed the request arguing that the prosecution had enough time to conduct investigations and   that it was unfair to hold Oyamo any longer in police custody. The lawyers also told court that detectives had extracted his DNA samples illegally while in custody at the Oyugis Police Station. Know if news is factual and true.
