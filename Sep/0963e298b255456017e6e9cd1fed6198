VAT: How a law dies or sees light of the day President Uhuru Kenyatta has proposed a reduction of VAT on petroleum products from 16 per cent to 8 per cent following what he terms as concerns from Kenyans over the rising fuel prices that are affecting cost of living. During the Friday briefing from State House, Uhuru said he now expects ERC to reduce prices of petrol in Nairobi from Sh127 to Sh118 and diesel from Sh115 to Sh107. “I have spent the last few days listening to views and it is clear that you are all concerned with rising petrol prices,” said Uhuru. In his address, Uhuru listed the development projects since the Jubilee administration took over in 2013, among them is the Standard Gauge Railway, maternal care, free primary education, free public day secondary school education and the availability of textbooks. He said all the projects needed the money and had propelled the country to new heights of development. Avoid fake news!
