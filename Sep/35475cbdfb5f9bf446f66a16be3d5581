Sharon's foetus burial postponed According to Luo community culture where the two hail from, a married lady must be buried in her husband’s home unless there is a serious obstacle. The Standard has learnt that Sharon will be buried at her grandfather’s home at Magare village in Homa Bay County, contrary to many peoples’ expectations. Owuor is said to have sired two girls with Sharon before they separated. But Sharon’s step-grandfather John Olweya who spoke to journalists on behalf of the family revealed that they had distanced themselves from the husband. Olweya said Owuor had never visited their home to make his marriage with Sharon official. “We are not aware of any marriage between Sharon and any man. The said husband has never paid us dowry and has failed to visit this family to notify us that he was living with Sharon,” he said. Avoid fake news!

But the position of this family is that Sharon had no husband,” added Olweya. The family has therefore resolved to bury Sharon in the home of her paternal grandfather Samuel Odege. The burial date has however not been scheduled. Family lead lawyer Peter Kaluma said they would not bury her until her killers are apprehended. ALSO READ:
