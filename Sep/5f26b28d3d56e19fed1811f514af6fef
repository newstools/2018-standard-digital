EACC expose fraud at NCPB Locks on the doors of Muhammad Swazuri's (pictured) office at Ardhi House were changed at the weekend after it emerged that he did not follow the right procedure to go back last week. The action followed a meeting between the National Land Commission (NLC) acting CEO, David Kuria, Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission Deputy CEO Michael Mubea and the Director of Public Prosecutions on Friday. The meeting at the EACC offices resolved to lock Prof Swazuri out of the office until the right procedure was followed. A court order had allowed him to go back to his office. “NLC failed to consult EACC, as directed by the courts, before being allowed back into the office. Until that is followed, he will be out,” said a source. Swazuri's secretary was also told to stay away until she gets an alternative office.

His lawyer, Tom Ojienda, said he will go back to court for further directions. “They locked the doors at the commission by changing the locks and even his secretary can't access the office. We will move to court for further directions,” Prof Ojienda told The Standard. Officials at EACC said they were not consulted, as directed by the court, to allow Swazuri back into office, hence the need to lock him out. ALSO READ:
