Sharon's mysterious trip to Tanzania before her murder "Something had to give in," the lawyer told reporters, blaming the Director of Criminal Investigations and the Director  of Public Prosecutions of giving in to public pressure. He said Sharon was murdered viciously and the governor couldn't have done it considering they were lovers. The police have linked Obado to the murder of  the seven-month-pregnant  Rongo University medical statistics student after DNA analysis revealed he was the father of the unborn baby. The foetus died  after the mother was stabbed in the abdomen with the blow tearing through it. On September 11, 2018, Governor Obado alongside his personal assistant Michael Oyamo and journalist Barrack Oduor were questioned by the DCI detectives for the first time since Sharon’s brutal murder. Obado joins five other suspects including his personal assistant Oyamo, bodyguard Elvis Omondi and a clerk in the county Caspal Obiero who are in police custody over the brutal murder and abduction of Barrack Oduor.
