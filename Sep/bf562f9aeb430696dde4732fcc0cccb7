Rwandan warlord and fugitive Felicien Kabuga’s wife wants the court to dismiss a case filed by the State 10 years ago seeking to freeze their joint property in Lavington, Nairobi. Josphine Mukazitoni, in her submissions filed before the Anti-Corruption Court in Nairobi, argued that the Government had no proof that the contested property was acquired through proceeds of crime.

Documents seen by The Standard show that the house fetches at least Sh84,000 rent each month. “The applicant (Attorney General) has not demonstrated that Mr Felicien Kabuga is using the income generated in Kenya to avoid capture and substantially interfere with the prosecution witnesses,” her submissions, filed by Ogeto Otachi advocates, read. Attaches proof She continued: “On the contrary, the applicant attaches proof that the funds are actually wired directly to the second respondent’s (Mukazitoni) accounts. Furthermore, there is no proof that the property was unlawfully acquired or relates to any crime.” Stay informed while on the go by subscribing to the Standard Group SMS service.

A warrant for his arrest was issued on November 26, 1997, but the man has never been captured. The ICTR, in its request for assistance, noted that Kabuga was using the money collected from the property to evade law enforcement agencies. ALSO READ:
