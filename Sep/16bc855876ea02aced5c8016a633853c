Officers in the lower cadres will get a three per cent increase while those in the higher ones will receive two per cent in the second phase. The increment has drawn criticism from many officers, who said it was too little. Insiders said the increment followed crisis meetings by the National Police Service Commission (NPSC).

They said it was not commensurate with the work they do. Policemen's salaries vary depending on experience. Allowances also differ.
