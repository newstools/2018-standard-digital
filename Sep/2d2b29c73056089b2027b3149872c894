Police in Mbeere South, Embu County have retrieved from a river the body of an adult male suspected to be that of a missing Nairobi businessman. The decomposing body was found trapped inside a damaged car in River Thiba, at Urua village by residents who spotted the roof of the vehicle and informed the police.

Mbeere South OCPD Ahmed Mohammed said a DNA test will be conducted to establish if the body is that Maina. He added that they were trying to match the fingerprints. His family have, however, confirmed that it was his car. Maina had reportedly visited his farm in Embu when he went missing. “We suspect the vehicle was swept away by floods in April and carried for about six kilometers to where it was found trapped by two huge rocks.
