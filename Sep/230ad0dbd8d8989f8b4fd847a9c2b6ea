MCAs pass motion to get mounted screens for public viewing The action was taken when MCAs from two rival groups, each of which is trying to control the house, nearly came to blows over a new team to head the assembly's business. About three weeks ago, 22 Jubilee MCAs met in a Nakuru hotel and announced that they had thrown out the majority leader, Kamau Gathungu, and his deputy, Ken Mukira. The majority chief whip, Hussein Kassana, was also purportedly kicked out. Mr Gathungu was replaced by North Kinangop MCA Edinald King’ori while Mr Mukira was replaced by Kiriita MCA Justus Gaita. Mr Kassana was replaced by his deputy, Wangari Methu, while Nominated MCA Geoffrey Ngaruiya was elected deputy chief whip. The ejected leaders went to court, seeking orders to stop the new team from taking over. On Wednesday, trouble started when Mr King'ori sat in the chair reserved for Gathungu. A shouting match ensued, prompting Mr Wahome to intervene. The speaker asked the two members to occupy any empty seat "as no seat is electronically allocated”.
