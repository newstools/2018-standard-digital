The county assembly has passed three affirmative action Bills. The Gender and Social Development Bill, the Persons with Disabilities Bill and the Youth Development Bill will facilitate equal opportunities for women, youth and disabled persons. The Bills also propose the creation of three kitties, namely the County Social Development Fund, the County Disability Fund and the Youth Fund, for marginalised groups. County Assembly Speaker Abdu Kassim yesterday said the Bills would become law when they are signed by Governor Fahim Twaha in the next 14 days. “The Bills were fast-tracked because members of the county assembly realised that they would uplift the lives of many women, youth and disabled persons who need funds for their business ideas,” Mr Kassim said. He added that the county intended to uplift the lives of disadvantaged people wishing to work in the informal sector. “We expect that once the three Bills become law, money will be set aside every financial year to aid in building local businesses." According to sources in the county government, each of the funds was likely to receive Sh20 million each financial year to fund business start-ups.

The speaker also said the MCAs were likely to pass the Disaster Management Bill 2018, with the draft still being discussed before being tabled in the county assembly. The Bill is meant to inform the funding and management of disasters in the county, which does not have a legal framework for search-and-rescue operations. Lack of legislation has resulted in more than 20 deaths this year from ocean-related accidents. Search-and-rescue operations are underfunded, if not non-existent, and rescue operations are usually done by the Kenya Maritime Authority, with the assistance of well-wishers and the Kenya Red Cross Society.
