Parliament being used as State House rubberstamp, MP says Speaking in Nyando during a church funds drive on Sunday, senators James Orengo (Siaya), Moses Kajwang' (Homa Bay) and Samson Cherargei (Nandi) said they were putting up a plan that would see Kenyans partly cushioned from the impacts of the increase in fuel prices. Mr Orengo said even though there was need to pay tax, the Government should explain the reason for the taxation.
