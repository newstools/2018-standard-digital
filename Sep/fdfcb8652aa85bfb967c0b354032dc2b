The five Kenyans and two Koreans aboard a ship stricken off the Seychellois coast have been identified. International Transport Federation Mombasa Port Inspector Betty Makena named the Kenyans as Maitha Allan Kazungu (able seaman), Owili Moses Otieno, Juma Rashi Zahoro, Ochieng Kennedy Otieno and Ngwaru Ngumbao Katana. The ship master is Korean Kim Daegeon and the chief electrician is Lee Yung Jong. Maritime officials indicated yesterday that efforts to re-float the Kenyan flagged ship, which ran aground on August 24, have been delayed by low tides. The vessel, named Diamond Ace Number 1, ran aground on a reef in the vicinity of Long and Cerf Island. Seychelles maritime authorities are waiting for a tide of at least 1.7m to start an operation to remove the fishing vessel. The operation has been postponed to September 6, when tide movements are expected to be more favourable. “We need a tug to pull the vessel. Information that we have gathered will help us know where to tie the boat and place the tugs,” said Egbert Moustache, the deputy chief executive of Seychelles Port Authority.
