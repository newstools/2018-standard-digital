This follows a chaotic scene that gripped City Hall as the MCAs tried to kick the speaker out of her office, telling that her services are no longer needed. Below is a copy of the memo:  Last week Speaker Beatrice Elachi was impeached after 103 members voted to pass a motion that was moved by Waithaka Ward Representative Antony Kiragu. The MCAs argued that Elachi had failed to meet the requirements of the chapter 6 of the constitution and that she is not qualified to lead the house. Avoid becoming a victim of Fake News.

This was however a short-lived ouster since Ms Elachi went to Employment and Labour Relations Court and acquired an order preventing the House from ejecting her and interfering with her duties. On Tuesday, the members through the Senior Lawyer Prof Tom Ojienda requested the court to quash the order on the premise that Elachi did not swear an affidavit to back her petition. But in her rejoinder through her Lawyer Harrisson Kinyanjui, She argued that she could not have sword the affidavit since she was attending a devolution conference. The court will issue its ruling on the case on Friday. ALSO READ:
