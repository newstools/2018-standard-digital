Parable of man who built on riparian land Gorasia had done everything possible to try and save his building from the inevitable. And for five years he managed to keep the dreaded demolition squad at bay. Airgate Centre formerly known as Taj Mall in Embakasi, Nairobi, is being demolished. Gorasia has since condemned the Taj Mall demolition urging the Directorate of Criminal Investigation to investigate those who approved the construction. He maintained that he got approvals for construction of Taj Mall in 1995 and has renewed them seven times since then. “They gave approvals based on the title deed which was genuine and the land rates which were all paid,” he said.

In his first time appearance in public last month, Gorasia invoked God’s name in his defence after reality of the impending demolition sunk in. “God is watching. Whoever wants to mess my life, it’s okay. God will punish them,” he said upon receiving a 15-day vacate notice from the Multi-Sectoral Committee on Unsafe Structures. The building has been blamed for the mess that is Outering Road. ALSO READ:
