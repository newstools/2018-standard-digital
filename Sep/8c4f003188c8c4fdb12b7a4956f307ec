Obado: How my wife busted me with Sharon Migori County police commander Joseph Nthenge could neither confirm nor deny the arrest. The impounded car is parked at a police station. Mr Nthenge confirmed that they had interrogated two people in connection with the killing of the student. Officers on patrol in Migori are said to have sighted the car as it was being driven by a senior county official, who may have hired it unknowingly. The car, whose recovery may help the police in tracing the student's killers still at large, has been missing since the incident two weeks ago. Sharon and Oduor had travelled from Homa Bay County to meet with Governor Okoth Obado's Personal Assistant Michael Oyamo, who is in police custody.
