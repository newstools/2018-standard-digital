He is diabetic and he should be released on police bond,” Karanja said, adding that their visit to Njoro Police Station was in solidarity with the deputy speaker. Tonui and 10 other suspects were arrested on Friday in connection with the ethnic-based violence that has rocked Nessuit Ward, which he represents. At least eight people have been killed and 12 others admitted at the Nakuru Level 5 Hospital. Some 60 houses and business premises have been torched in the violence that erupted last Sunday. The violence is said to have been triggered by an eviction notice issued to illegal settlers in the Mau forest by the Government. Avoid fake news!
