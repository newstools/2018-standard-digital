Trains slowed down by clogged city cargo depot CCCC engineers used the New Austrian Tunneling Method (NATM) of drilling and blasting to build the tunnel. This is the first time that such a method has been used on such large scale in Kenya, according to Mr Steve Zhao, the CCCC Kenya SGR Project Spokesperson. The tunneling method is economical, efficient and has strong adaptability for different geological and groundwater conditions. What is more, the method controls surface collapse effectively, and enhances the working environment during construction.  For the first time, local and international journalists were shown inside the tunnel to take pictures. Speaking separately to the Standar during a tour of the tunnel that was commissioned on Tuesday, Steve Zhao said 146 refuge holes of different sizes have been built within the tunnel to allow maintenance workers to take cover as the train approaches.
