The ANC leader said there was a crisis of confidence over Jubilee government’s inability to efficiently manage the economy and Kenyans have lost confidence in government over its financial indiscipline and endemic corruption. “This is magnified by the fact that a large chunk of the burdensome loans and the budget are stolen within government bureaucracy. The ruling party cadres are at variance with the president, they have been misdirecting him,” he said. He said the president himself had voiced disappointment with the shabby performance of his Treasury appointees in providing cogent economic solutions. “This disaffection within and outside government concerning lack of consistent fiscal policies is pervasive. But the Jubilee government is living denial over the rampage borrowing spree that has boomeranged.”  Know if news is factual and true. Text 'NEWS' to 22840 and always receive verified news updates.
