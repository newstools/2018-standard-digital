Why we need to visualise aviation beyond airplanes, airports “We have opened a Euro Account to offer our guests more flexibility for payment options at all our sales outlets in Kenya. We want to offer our guests choices that enable them to pay in either the Kenya Shilling, Euro or the US Dollar,” Kenya Airways Group Managing Director and CEO Sebastian Mikosz said. Due to the increasing number of multinational corporations and the foreign missions based in Kenya, opening a Euro Account provides a suitable payment solution to many Kenya Airways guests. The introduction of this additional payment option will make it more convenient for guests from the European Union and increase sales for the Pride of Africa. According to the Economic Survey 2018, majority of the 250,000 visitors who toured Kenya from the European Union, last year, were from Germany, France, Italy, Poland, Romania, Netherlands and Belgium.
