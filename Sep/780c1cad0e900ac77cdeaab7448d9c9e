Absolutely. There is neutrality on our side as politicians from Narok County, and security officers led by county head George Natembeya are doing an excellent job. If you ask me, I would call on every civil servant to do what Mr Natembeya is doing - follow the law without taking sides or standing intimidated before politicians. ALSO READ:

Five killed in clashes as politicians face probe For example, what politicians from Narok are after is conservation. The only trouble comes from politicians from the North Rift who, interestingly, want to stop the evictions, yet the country needs the Mau for streams to be nourished to save millions of people from hunger brought about by drought. If you talk of being partisan, then these are the people who are partisan, else the leadership of Mau is keen to ensure that everyone who is illegal in the Mau quits. The President has already pronounced himself on the matter and wants settlers in the forest to pave the way for conservation. This has led to many illegal settlers being kicked out. I call on him to protect security officers working in Narok County from political attacks and ensure that everyone living in the forest is kicked out. The Maasai Mau will be preserved by all means because we, the Maasai politicians, are neutral and will not take anything less than conservation, and so are security chiefs in the region.
