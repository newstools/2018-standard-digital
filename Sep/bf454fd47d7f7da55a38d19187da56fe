Finance and Planning Committee Chairman Joseph Kiguru said the authority would help bridge the financing gap as well as promote investments through public private partnership. “Having managed large private and public institutions, I believe Mworia has a good understanding of what investors want and he has a huge understanding of private investment sector,” he said. If the county implements the County Integrated Development Plan (CIDP) as conceived, the Mworia-led board would be responsible for bridging the Sh15 billion mismatch between the funds required and available money. Financing gap Know if news is factual and true. Text 'NEWS' to 22840 and always receive verified news updates.
