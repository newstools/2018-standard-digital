During the operation, 13 people were arrested. They were charged with importation and sale of LPG without valid licences issued under the Energy Act 2006. ERC has vowed to intensify countrywide surveillance in the LPG sector to curb malpractices, ranging from importation and sale of LPG that does not meet Kenyan standards to transportation of bulk LPG without a valid licence from ERC. Huge losses Other charges were wholesale of bulk LPG without a licence from ERC and operation of storage and filling plants without valid licences. Avoid fake news!
