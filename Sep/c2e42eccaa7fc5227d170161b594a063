Why status quo must remain in the Premier League this weekend In the first point, Okoth is pushing for decriminalization of handling of the drug and amnesty for those who may have been prosecuted for using or growing the plant. Secondly, he is pushing for proper regulation of the marijuana farming sector. This he says will cater for the growers, traders and protecting minors once the step is achieved. He is further urging the government to set up institutions of research to aid in medical use of the product as well as other areas regarding intellectual property rights. His fourth argument is that once legal, the product will present the government with a tax haven coming handy with employment opportunities. He presented his proposal to National Assembly Speaker Justin Muturi today, pending further deliberations on it.
