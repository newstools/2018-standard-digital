The Form Three girls were reported to have sneaked out of the school on Sunday morning. Their whereabouts remain unknown. The area chief, Christopher Amunze, went with officers from Cyprus Police Post to arrest the boys after it was alleged that they were spotted with the girls.

"We received information that they were seen with some boys from a neighboring school,” Mr Omega told journalists. He blamed the disappearance of the girls on local men who prey on them for sex, leading to early pregnancy. A parent of one of the missing girls on Monday demanded that the school authorities produce his daughter. "It is the responsibility of the school administration to ensure students are in school. I want to know the whereabouts of my daughter,” he said. He accused the school administration of failing in its responsibility of ensuring the security of students. "We agreed with the school administration that no student should be allowed to leave without the knowledge of his or her parent and it seems teachers are not keen on this resolution,” he said.
