The proposed levies target have broadened into previously spared sectors such as public transport and small traders as well as waste disposal. Once the Bill is approved by the county assembly, fishermen will have to pay a daily tax of Sh200 as fish traders pay Sh300. Boats carrying fish exceeding 10 tones will pay Sh5000 while those ferrying less than 10 tones pay Sh1000. Also, Omena (dagaa) and fish will be taxed Sh100 and Sh70 per basket. Fishermen refuted the new taxes calling for the MCAs present during a forum at Aga Khan Hall to return the bill to the assembly and lower the costs because they rely on fishing for their survival.
