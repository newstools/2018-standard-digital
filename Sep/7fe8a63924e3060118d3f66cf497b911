The other controversial levy is the Sh200 that locals will pay for a permit to cut down their trees. The locals are against the new taxes and want the County Assembly to reject the Bill. "You cannot charge me to have my tree cut, if it goes ahead I will not plant any more trees. Such taxes are absurd," said Abdul Wanyonyi, a resident. The new rates will also affect sand harvesters who will owe the county Sh1,000 for every trip of a full lorry. Locals who harvest sand are opposed to the new rates, given they sell a lorry of sand at Sh1,200. Stay informed while on the go by subscribing to the Standard Group SMS service.

Traditional herbalists and healers will also have to pay a levy of Sh10,000 yearly. The renovated Bhukungu Stadium has also been earmarked to source for more revenues. The Bill proposes that those who will want to use the VVIP lounge should pay Sh20,000 per day. The stadium's parking lot will be open to the public at Sh300 per night. ALSO READ:
