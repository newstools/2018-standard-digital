Kikuyu Mp Kimani Ichungwa argues with retired cleric Timothy Njoya after the Mp lead parents to storm into Kinoo girls. [George Njunge / Standard] There was drama on Friday in Kikuyu as MP Kimani Ichung’wah accompanied by parents and other locals forcefully merged two neighbouring schools in Kinoo. PCEA Kinoo Girls under the Presbyterian Church of East Africa and Mama Ngina Senior School started by the MP are separated by a fence. But on Friday morning, Kimani and his group arrived at Mama Ngina Senior, a mixed school, and told the 300 students to carry their desks, chairs and books, and move to the next school. Kinoo Girls has a student population of 100. Ichung’wah said the school stands on public land and they had all the rights to merge the two schools into one bigger institution. “The public land was illegally and irregularly subdivided by the PCEA Church. There is no problem since we are taking what belongs to us,” said the legislator. But retired PCEA Rev Timothy Njoya accused Ichung’wah of breaking the law through the take-over. “Kinoo Girls is a school under the Presbyterian Church that legally holds the title deed since 1902. The church also owns Mama Ngina Primary and a graveyard,” Njoya said. Avoid becoming a victim of Fake News. Subscribe to the Standard Group SMS service by texting 'NEWS' to 22840.
