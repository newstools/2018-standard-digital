Up to six million pupils in Standard One, Two and Three in public schools have benefited from a new method of teaching mathematics. Math teachers returned a positive verdict for a new teaching methods programme during training of subject teachers in Murang'a South sub-county, Murang'a County, last week. They said pupils' understanding of basic mathematical concepts had improved. The 227 teachers are part of 100,000 being trained in teaching mathematics throughout the country. The training is being conducted under the auspices of the Kenya Global Partnership for Education (GPE) Primary Education Development (PRIEDE). According to Murang'a South Sub-County Director of Education Edith Kariuki, learners' absence in school had gone down since the new teaching methods were introduced. “Pupils now attend school more regularly than they have ever done,” she said.

Early Grade Mathematics head Hellen Borwet, who oversaw the two-day training in Murang'a and Kiambu counties, said learners had shown great improvement in their understanding of basic mathematical concepts. “These concepts provide the foundation for learning in subsequent years of a child’s formal learning and life skills.”
