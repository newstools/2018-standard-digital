Ward reps squabble over assembly teams “There is a whirlwind coming to this county, which will not be easy to dodge. We hope the whirlwind will mean well for the people of Vihiga,” Mr Ijaika said. He added: “In the last financial year, Sh1.3 billion was not used for the intended projects, yet we are told the governor is still planning. For how long will he plan?" Mr Odei accused the governor of pushing them to the wall. “We do not have funds to initiate development projects in the wards. For how long will we wait?” he asked. Mr Atsiaya claimed Mr Ottichilo had made questionable appointments. “The people of Vihiga are suffering because we have people in office who do not know what they are doing. Before 2022, we are going to impeach Ottichilo so that former governor Moses Akaranga can come and finish his work,” he said. Know if news is factual and true.
