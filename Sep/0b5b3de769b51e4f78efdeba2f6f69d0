Tears, pain during the requiem mass of Mwingi accident pupils County Assembly Service Board Vice Chairman Johnson Kanandu told The Standard this would give them time to prepare adequately for the ceremony. Mr Kanandu, the Mumoni ward representative in Mwingi North, said the board had formed a committee to look into the possibility of tentatively holding the ceremony on September 21 or 28. He said they would invite National Assembly Speaker Justin Muturi as chief guest, Machakos and Makueni assembly speakers, Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka and Governor Charity Ngilu, among other guests. Kanandu, who was with Kyangithya West MCA Boniface Katumo, said the Sh247 million complex, whose construction started in 2014, was ready.  “We appreciate support from the board, members of the assembly, assembly staff and the good political will within and outside the county which has made this possible,” he said. Speaking in July, assembly speaker George Ndotto had said the initial 12 months contract period slated to start on April 7, 2015 was interrupted by court orders that halted the works. “Eight months from July, 2015 to February 2, 2016 were lost in court battles, hence extending the completion date to December 4, 2016,” said Ndotto who is also the chairman of the board.
