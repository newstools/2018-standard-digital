They face higher risks of mercury poisoning,” the report says. According to the report, the mercury used by the miners is laced with cyanide and is a major source of pollution in gold mining areas. Exposure to heavy metals used in gold mines has been linked to respiratory and heart diseases as well as kidney failure. “Large doses of cyanide prevent cells from using oxygen and eventually these cells die. The heart, respiratory system, and central nervous system are most susceptible to cyanide poisoning, which is highly life-threatening,” states the report. Know if news is factual and true.
