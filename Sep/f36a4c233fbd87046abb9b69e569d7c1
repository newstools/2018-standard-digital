"Yes. I am supporting 16 per cent VAT on fuel. I am not ashamed of it. I am not pretentious. And yes I know I will lose some of my friends and supporters. But my principles are more important to me as a Christian, a leader and a man who went to the river and not for fetching water to build a mud-walled house."

This then gives Parliament the liberty to either adopt President's recommendations or reject them. The MPs also have an option of approving the bill in its original form. Should they resolve to approve the Financial Bill 2018 in its original form, it must be supported by not less than 65 per cent of all the members of National Assembly. For now, it's a matter of 'let's wait to see'
