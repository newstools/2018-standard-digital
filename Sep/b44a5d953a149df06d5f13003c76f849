Ruto vows to continue with development agenda “Water is a devolved function and there should have been consultation before the decision was made,” Governor Waiguru said. “This has affected services in hospitals, schools and even farming,” she added. Governor Kimemia said, “many homes have also run out of water as a result of the order’s enforcement by Kenya Forest Service and Water Resources management Board in the Aberdare and Mt. Kenya Forests.” The Governors called on National Government to consult with County Governments as water is a devolved function and arbitrary disconnections are bound to lead to water shortages that gravely affect county residents.
