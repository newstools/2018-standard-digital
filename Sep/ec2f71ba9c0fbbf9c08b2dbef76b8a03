Kilifi North MP Owen Baya has written to Orange Democratic Movement (ODM) party leader Raila Odinga seeking the removal of John Mbadi as National Assembly Leader of Minority. Mr Baya, who is the party’s deputy organising secretary, wants Mr Mbadi (pictured), the ODM chairman, removed on grounds of incompetence and lacking an ideological identity. ALSO READ:

Raila runs into angry residents protesting against tax “Mbadi is in full character same as Leader of Majority Aden Duale in and outside the House... (the two) are now ideologically Siamese twins joined at the head and hip,” said Baya in his letter. “This is absolutely wrong in the presidential system of governance where the minority (Opposition) is the government in waiting.” Baya described Mbadi, who is the Suba South MP, as an unconvincing and weak mobiliser who could not convince or hold the minority side together. Of concern to him is the Finance Bill and the presidential reservations memorandum in which more than 90 per cent of legislators voted against his preferred position because he failed to influence them with his leadership. “He was unable to read the mood of the minority side, which he leads, and was unable to manage them. He completely failed to provide leadership in the House during the debate and party members openly overran his abilities,” he said. Know if news is factual and true.
