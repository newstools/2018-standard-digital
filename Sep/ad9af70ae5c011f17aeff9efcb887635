A seven-year-old girl shot by police has been discharged from hospital amid calls for action against the officer responsible for her injuries. Fatma Yusuf, a Standard One pupil at St Thomas Primary School in Kiembeni, was discharged from Coast General Hospital after an operation to remove a bullet from her thigh. The police have admitted to shooting the girl, who was discharged on Saturday, but claim she was hit by a stray bullet. The officer who fired the shot has not been arrested as his seniors maintain it was an accident. Hussein Khalid, from rights group Haki Afrika, urged Director of Public Prosecutions Noordin Haji to order the arrest and prosecution of the officer. “We have had many cases of stray bullets hitting innocent people and the victims never get justice,” Mr Khalid said. “This week alone, we have recorded three cases where people have accidentally been shot by police who claim they were pursuing criminals. “This is a matter that needs to be addressed immediately. The officers involved in these incidents should be investigated and those found guilty arrested and prosecuted.” Stay informed while on the go by subscribing to the Standard Group SMS service.

They only took us to the hospital the day my daughter was shot. We have not heard from them. I want justice for my daughter.” The county government waived the Sh50,000 bill for Fatma, who was in hospital for two weeks. The police said the girl was hit accidentally as they pursued criminals in Kisauni on August 15.
