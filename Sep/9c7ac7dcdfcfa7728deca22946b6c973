Car maker Toyota Kenya plans to partner with the Bungoma County government to improve mechanisation of agriculture in the region. The firm's chairman, Dennis Awori, said Toyota had invested in an academy to train technical personnel, some of whom would engage in agri-mechanisation. “We are focused on supporting the county government in the agri-mechanisation sector through training for farmers and better post-harvest techniques,” he said during the launch of a Toyota Kenya Approved Service Centre in Bungoma town yesterday.

Deputy Governor Charles Ngome said the launch of the service centre would help the county cut the costs of maintaining its fleet. Mr Ngome said the county government previously had to service its vehicles in either Kisumu or Kericho. “We applaud the launch of this service centre as it will help cut costs by almost half.”
