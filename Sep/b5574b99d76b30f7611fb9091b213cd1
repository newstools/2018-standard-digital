White House wobbles on U.S. flag after McCain death Family and friends, along with the Naval Academy’s class of 1958 and its current student body, bade a final farewell in a private service at the Naval Academy chapel before McCain, who died Aug. 25 at age 81, was interred in a cemetery on the academy grounds. “I watched them lay my friend to rest today. I will miss him,” Senator Jeff Flake, who represented Arizona alongside McCain in Congress, wrote on Twitter. Crowds gathered along the route of the motorcade bearing McCain’s body.

I’ll shed a tear and yet I’ll thank God that I knew a man like John McCain so well.”
