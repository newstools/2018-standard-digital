With about four years to the next General Election, what seems as a battle for the Busia governorship has started in earnest.

Bunyasi who is serving his second term as the Nambale constituency lawmaker accepted the endorsement and observed that he was ready to compete with others who will emerge. “I have traversed better part of the county to get some reactions and held consultative meetings with various leaders, there is goodwill,” said Bunyasi. Sources say that Bunyasi is a very a close ally of Amani National Congress (ANC) Musalia Mudavadi and may choose to vie on ANC party ticket. The Agricultural Finance Cooperation (AFC) Managing Director Lucas Meso and Engineer Vincent Sidai who contested in 2013 on United Democratic Forum (UDF) but lost to Governor Ojaamong have also shown interest for the Busia County boss seat.
