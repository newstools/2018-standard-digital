A man is nursing serious injuries after he was shot in the leg. Ephantus Kipkoech, 38, a teacher at Sondu River village in Kuresoi North, was caught up in a clash between youths and three Administration Police officers at Sondu trading centre yesterday. “I was about to leave the trading centre when I heard a commotion. The youths turned rowdy and the police officers started shooting in the air. A bullet hit me in the leg,” said Mr Kipkoech. According to witnesses, the officers, who were not in uniform, were accosted by residents after they allegedly started demanding bribes from the drunk revellers whom they had arrested. “When they were confronted and asked for identification, they became hostile. The residents freed those arrested, prompting the shooting,” said James Rotich, a witness. Kipkoech, who lay on the ground bleeding, was saved by passengers who had disembarked from a matatu.

After people dispersed we came to his aid,” said Gideon Kosgei, one of the rescuers. At Molo Level Four Hospital, doctors removed the bullet lodged in Kipkoech’s right thigh. He was then referred to Tenwek Hospital in Bomet for further treatment. “Our investigations reveal that the officers are attached to Total AP Camp, which is in Molo geographically but under Kuresoi North administratively. Further investigations are being carried out by senior officers from Kuresoi,” said Molo OCPD Bernard Kioko. According to Kuresoi North OCPD Hesborn Kadenge, the officers were neither on official duty nor had they been assigned guns or a vehicle to conduct a crackdown on illicit brew dens. Kuresoi North Deputy County Commissioner Felix Wafula said the matter had been taken up by the DCIO.
