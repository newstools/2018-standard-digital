Outa and professor Nyong’o have been engaged in a cold war that led to a fallout after Nyong’o fired his Chief of Staff Patrick Ouya, an ally of Outa, over “professional misconduct”. But yesterday, Outa called on county leaders to stop divisive politics that are “misleading people”. Speaking in Nyando during the launch of a child support programme that will benefit more than 1,000 children, the senator said they will focus on developing the county. “This is the time for development.
