My government’s Big Four agenda on food security, housing, manufacturing and healthcare will contribute towards reducing the burden of TB,” Uhuru said. Deputy Secretary General to the UN Amina Mohammed said progress towards ending TB was uneven, slow and fragile, and called on countries to do more. “TB needs a system-wide approach that promotes the broader health and well-being of entire communities and breaks out of disease-specific silos and single goals,” Ms Mohammed said. The disease, which infects 10.4 million people globally, is the world’s biggest infectious killer, claiming 4,500 lives every day. “TB knows no borders,” said World Health Organisation Director General Tedros Adhanom. “It thrives in poverty, malnutrition or conflict. We must reach everyone with quality care... by 2022.” Know if news is factual and true. Text 'NEWS' to 22840 and always receive verified news updates.
