The letter dated July 24 seen by Sunday Standard is signed by father Tambo of Milimani Parish. Ruto was recently in Kisumu where he attended the wedding of a couple from the Asian community, in what was described as a purely private affair. He did not speak to the public. But Ruto has not visited Luo land, where ODM leader Raila Odinga – perceived as his political nemesis – hails from, choosing to focus on swing vote areas like Kisii, Western and Kuria. He has made several forays into Kisii and Western Kenya since re-election.

Father Oliver Tambo, of Kisumu Mlimani Catholic Parish, also urged DP Ruto to arrange visits to Nyanza region. “The church faithfully answers God’s call to love others. We must explain and demonstrate that love without ceasing, to apply it meaningfully,” the priest said. ALSO READ:
