  South Africa’s mainly white Solidarity union will begin a strike today at petrochemicals firm Sasol over a share ownership scheme offered exclusively to black staff.

Goal-shy Sundowns eliminated “We intend to switch off a different section of Sasol each day by means of well-laid and strategic plans,” the union said in a statement. Sasol, world leader in the technology that converts coal and gas to fuel, said last year it would raise its black ownership levels in Sasol South Africa to at least 25 percent in a 21 billion rand ($1.5 billion) deal.
