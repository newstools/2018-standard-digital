Boundary review set to kick off in 2020 Speaking at Jamboni in Uasin Gishu on Sunday, Dr Khalwale (pictured) said his decision was based on the changing political trends. "I am a seasoned politician and I have been keen to know who becomes President every electioneering year. It has come to my attention that in Africa, you cannot defeat a candidate of a sitting president and that is why I have decided that I will not waste time waiting for results to be relayed by Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission. I choose to support Ruto in 2022," he said. He urged voters in the western region to support Ruto. "All the citizens should re-think what I have said. William Ruto will be announced winner in 2022 even if you defeat him," he noted. Khalwale told Amani party leader Musalia Mudavadi to back Ruto and "you will earn yourself a deputy president slot".
