But Mutua, through his press secretary, Mutinda Mwanzia, dismissed yesterday's protest as a political witch-hunt aimed at fanning unnecessary tension. “We also hope they will tell the public that they are the ones who wrote to the Controller of Budget to release recurrent monies for their salaries and allowances and asked her not to release funds for development,” said Mr Mwanzia. He claimed that the ward reps had refused to attend official meetings convened by the governor to discuss development. “Many of them are desperate because voters plan to recall them,” he said.
