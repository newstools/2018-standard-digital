[James Omoro, Standard] More than 500 households will benefit from a water project undertaken by the Belgium government in partnership with the county government. The project, to be implemented at Rodi Kopany Primary School, will entail sinking a borehole to allow for the piping of water. Deputy Governor Hamilton Orata and County Secretary Isaiah Ogwe officially launched the drilling of the borehole on Monday. Mr Orata said the water would be distributed to Kabunde Airstrip, Ndiru Primary School and households in the neighbourhood. “We want our institutions and residents to get water in their villages. This project will boost our initiative of curbing water shortages in the area,” Orata said.  Get live updates in Agriculture by subscribing to the new farmers TV SMS service.
