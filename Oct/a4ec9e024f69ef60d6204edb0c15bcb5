Violet Nzisa, wife to Nakuru Town East MP David Gikaria, yesterday appeared in court after she was cited for contempt. Nzisa was directed to appear in court last Friday after she was arrested for contempt and released on Sh100,000 personal bond. She was ordered by the court on October 13, last year to pay Martha Onganga Sh738,721 after she hit the latter with a car in 2016. Nzisa did not pay the money. Ms Onganga is a police officer attached to Central Police Station in Nakuru. The officer was on her way to Kaptembwo police station on a motorcycle when the accident occurred. “I sustained a spinal injury and was admitted to Kijabe Hospital for five months. I instituted the suit and the court ruled in my favour. I am yet to receive the money,” said Onganga. The officer had asked for general damages, payment of future medical expenses and any other relief the court might have deemed fit. Yesterday, Nzisa, who kept her face covered while in court, said she did not have enough money to pay Onganga Sh100,000 every month as she had pledged and pleaded that she be paying Sh20,000 monthly instead.
