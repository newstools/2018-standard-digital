As President Uhuru Kenyatta marks a year since he began his second term in office, he might take pride in the impressive numbers flying out of Herufi House. At the heart of Nairobi City, the building houses Kenya’s official statistician. According to the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics (KNBS), the economy has started picking up. Gross Domestic Product (GDP) or the sum of all finished goods and services produced in a market, increased by 5.7 per cent in the first quarter - the highest first quarter growth since 2015. It was even better in the second quarter of 2018 when GDP expanded by 6.3 per cent compared to 4.7 per cent during a similar quarter in 2017. It looks good on paper, until you get the ground. Maize farmers are on the verge of starvation as their produce rot in silos, and to add insult to injury the government is taking long to pay some of them for deliveries made to the National Cereals and Produce Board.
