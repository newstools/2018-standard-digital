In March this year, the establishment of an economic block for counties in Western Kenya was mooted. The rationale behind this was the need to create a vehicle that would drive the development agendas of the counties of Kisumu, Kakamega, Bungoma, Bomet, Homa Bay Busia, Kisii Kericho, Nandi, Migori, Nyamira, Siaya, Vihiga and Trans Nzoia. Through that initiative, the Lake Region Economic Bloc was formed. Devolution may have succeeded in bringing services closer to the people, but each county faces unique challenges whose solution may be found in partnerships with neighbouring counties. Thus, the creation of regional economic blocs to facilitate inter-county trade and to boost individual county economies is a noble idea. Over reliance on funds from the National Treasury has tended to slow growth momentum in counties, particularly when such funds are spent on recurrent expenditure instead of development. Counties need cooperation modelled on economic blocs like SADC, ECOWAS, MAGHREB and EAC that have been able facilitate trade, improve bilateral relationships and boost economies. ALSO READ:

Kiunjuri blames counties for low crop yields Yesterday, President Kenyatta opened the Lake Region Economic Bloc conference in Bomet.Â  The impact of these regional economic blocs should be brought to bear in a way that the ordinary citizens can feel and appreciate their existence. Without tangible income generating projects that directly affect citizens, efforts at economic blocs might as well be wasted. Other County regional economic blocs include North Rift Economic Bloc, the proposed South Eastern Kenya Economic Bloc and the Mt Kenya and Aberdares Counties Trade and Investment Bloc.
