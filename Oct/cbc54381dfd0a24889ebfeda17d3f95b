 A widow and her three children have been remanded at the Kitui GK Prison. They failed to raise a Sh2 million cash bail in a conspiracy to defraud case. Last Friday, Principal Magistrate Johson Munguti granted Kanini Kitili Mwengi, her children Benson Mwanzia Kitili and Mwengi Kitili, and her grandson Kitili Mwendwa a Sh500,000 cash bail each in a land transaction case. The four denied receiving Sh2.1 million from Paul Linguli on diverse dates between November 23, 2013 and January 29, 2014 for the sale of land parcel Kyangwithya/Tungutu/1124. In June, the High Court in Machakos declared the sale null and void. Stay informed while on the go by subscribing to the Standard Group SMS service. Text the word 'NEWS' to 22840.
