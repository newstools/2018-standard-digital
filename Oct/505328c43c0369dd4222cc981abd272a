The firm’s owner, Mohan Galot, denied the claims and countered that the estate was built in an industrial zone and should therefore be brought down. A directive by Nema that the factory ceases operations was issued on February 6, last year, but was not effected. After yesterday’s visit, the Nema team announced that the factory had made major changes to address the residents’ concerns. “We have established that numerous changes have been done to prevent pollution,” said Mr Iganga.

Sofi Mutemi, who is in charge of the Machakos Nema office, said they would monitor the factory to make sure it acquired a waste handling license. “Our idea was not to close down the factory, but to accommodate everybody, including the concerns of estate residents,” she said.
