Governor Okoth Obado shocked supporters and a congregation after showing up at a church unannounced. Mr Obado’s appearance at the Upper Hill SDA Church in Migori town came as a surprise as his handlers had earlier said he will spend a few more days in Nairobi after he was freed on a Sh5 million bail following his arrest over the murder of university student Sharon Otieno.

In a brief address to the congregation, he asked for prayers, saying he has been facing hard times. “God has been with me and I am requesting for more prayers,” he said. He later mingled with the congregation, greeting them as church members mobbed him. “He drove in silently and only a few people noticed him,” said a church goer.
