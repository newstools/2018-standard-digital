On October 5, Obado filed an application at the High Court to review the grounds used to deny him bail. In his application, the Governor said courtsâ€™ admittance to bail will not affect the ongoing investigations. Defence lawyer Nicholas Ombija urged the court to consider Obado's poor health and release him on bail. Obado was remanded at Industrial Area Prison, Nairobi, and later transferred to Kenyatta National Hospital. ALSO READ:
