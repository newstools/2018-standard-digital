 A man suspected of being behind increased theft cases in Mwimbi has been lynched. Dickson Muthomi Murungi, 40, who was released from jail a month ago, was lynched yesterday by villagers who suspected he had been involved in a theft two days earlier. Maara police boss Johnstone Kabusia said, the public, which had been looking for the suspect, cornered him yesterday. "Preliminary investigations indicate the community had been complaining that he was behind the theft of their property. It also seems local had not embraced the man after his release from jail," said Mr Kabusia. He said police were investigating the matter. "The law outlaws the killing of a person regardless of the nature of the offence. We will prosecute anyone found to have had a hand in the killing," he said.
