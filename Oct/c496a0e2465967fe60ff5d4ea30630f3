Court clears way for new bank notes High Court judge Mary Oundo ruled that the late Mwangi’s right to property under Article 40 of the Constitution had been violated by the government. “Ultimately, I do award the plaintiff Sh4 million as the amount payable as compensation for compulsory acquisition of his parcel of land in 1965 as well as Sh2,915,000 as mesne profit. The amount to be paid by the National Government promptly as required by the Constitution,” read the judgment delivered on October 4. Before his death, Mwangi had put loss of use incurred over the property at the rate of Sh5,000 per acre per year.

Mwangi’s son Timothy Macharia who took over the matter after the death of his parents ultimately got letters of administration of the estate allowing him to fight for what rightfully belonged to them.
