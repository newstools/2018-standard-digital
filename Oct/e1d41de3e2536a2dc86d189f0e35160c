The Mega Millions lottery jackpot has reached a record-breaking £1.26 billion ($1.6bn) after there was no winner of the £765 million ($1bn) prize. The prize pot has reached new heights after no player got all of the numbers of 15, 23, 53, 65, 70 and the Mega Ball 7 during Friday night's draw. The next Mega Millions draw will be held on Tuesday. If a player hits all six numbers to win the jackpot, they can opt for an immediate cash payment of £692 million ($90m) or receive the £1.26 billion ($1.6bn) prize over 29 years. Powerball, which held the record for the largest U.S. lottery prize of £1.213 billion ($1.586 bn) in 2016, will hold a separate draw on Saturday. Its jackpot rose on Friday to £360 million ($470m) from £329 million ($430m), with a lump sum value of £205 million ($268.6m). Mega Millions tickets are sold in 44 U.S. states, the District of Columbia and the Virgin Islands. If more than one winner is picked, the jackpot would be divided proportionately, as happened when the previous Mega Millions record of £502 million ($656m) was drawn in March 2012 and was shared by winners in Kansas, Illinois and Maryland, a lottery official said.
