It was a painful day to a glamorous girl- autopsy After conducting a second postmortem, Chief Government Pathologist Johansen Oduor (pictured) said the boy’s brain was swollen. He explained that the third examination was to establish whether the blood found in the boy’s lungs was as a result of a beating. “I have done another postmortem and the main thing I have seen is he had a swollen brain and his lungs had traces of blood. We want to know if the blood in the lungs is [as a result] of a disease, as was said by the first doctor, or if it was caused by the beating," he said. "If the boy was suffering from a lung infection, then it must be established what disease it is. We also want to establish if the swelling on the back was a disease or was inflicted by the beating.?” Dr Oduor said he detected bruises on the boy’s forehead. Avoid becoming a victim of Fake News.
