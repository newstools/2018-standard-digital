[Photo: Standard] A senior veterinary doctor was on Tuesday killed in a road accident. Joseph Liaulo, 34, was driving his Toyota RAV4 when he lost control of the vehicle, which rolled several times before landing in a ditch in Ratili near Mulot trading centre. Dr Liaulo died at the scene while his passenger, James Kosen, sustained minor injuries. Narok South OCPD Antony Shimoli said Liaulo was ferrying livestock medicine at the time of the accident. The vet will be remembered for his efforts in advocating for the welfare of donkeys when he worked with Farming System Kenya (FSK). During his stint at FSK in Narok, Liaulo successfully fought against the theft of donkeys, which were being slaughtered for their hides. Friends and colleagues described him as a jovial and ambitious man who always did his job professionally and passionately. ALSO READ:
