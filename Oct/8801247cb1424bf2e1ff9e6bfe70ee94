Tanzania police free 19 suspects held in abduction of billionaire Mr Ng’etich, in a statement seen by The Standard, claimed the MP assaulted him for supporting his political rival. He claimed he was bundled into the MP’s car after a football match at Kapset Sports Ground on Sunday. “I had just boarded a motorbike after a football match attended by the MP, his driver came and forcibly took me to the car. I was driven around the James tea estates for nearly three hours,” Ng’etich said after recording a statement at Mogogosiek police station. Ng’etich said the MP forced him to apologise then dropped him at Chebagang centre past 8pm. The MP has, however, denied assaulting the youth, saying he rescued Ng’etich from a mob that was baying for his blood after he tried to disrupt the match.
