He added: “Of all the leaders, we have seen his connection with Kenyans of all walks of life and we want him to succeed President Uhuru Kenyatta.” Nyaga said Tharaka Nithi despite playing a vital role in the country’s politics has been overlooked by successive administrations with little to show in terms of government appointments and development.
