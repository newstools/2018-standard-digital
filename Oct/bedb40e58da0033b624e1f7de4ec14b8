According to the prosecution, consultant psychiatrist Fredrick Owiti examined Onyancha and prepared a report indicating that he was suffering from residual schizophrenia. The court was told that the mental illness - within the meaning of the Mental Health Act 1988 - may have propelled him to commit the crimes he is charged with. The prosecution opposed the application for bail, saying Onyancha's life would be endangered if he was released. “The dictates of justice also requires that the accused person ought to be kept away from members of the public who are most likely to fall prey to his tendencies of sucking of human blood,” argues the prosecution.
