Sacking Chiloba was the only solution - Lobby group If his idea sails through, commissioners nominated by both Jubilee Party and National Super Alliance MPs would oversee the 2022 General Election. Mr Kaluma’s proposal is similar to one by the Inter-Parties Parliamentary Group (IPPG) of 1997, where political parties nominated members to the defunct Electoral Commission of Kenya (ECK). The IPPG then comprised Kenya African National Union, Democratic Party, Ford Kenya, Ford Asili and Safina. The parties were allocated slots in ECK according to their strength in Parliament. The parties then forwarded their nominees to the President for appointment. Kaluma’s proposal comes as the National Assembly's Justice and Legal Affairs committee is working on amendments to the IEBC Act to provide for appointment of the selection panel to fill vacancies yet to be announced by President Uhuru Kenyatta. Kaluma wants a law that states the commission established under Article 88 of the Constitution shall consist of a chairperson and four other members appointed in accordance with Article 250(4). He wants two persons, a man and a woman, nominated by the majority party or coalition of parties, two persons, a man and a woman, nominated by minority party or coalition of parties, and an advocate of the High Court elected by the advocates' professional body.
