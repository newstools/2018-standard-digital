Members of Parliament, officials from the party’s headquarters and members of county assemblies from at least four counties swarmed into the county and spread across the 826 polling stations in what they claimed was a strategy to guard against electoral malpractices. ODM leaders from Nairobi, Siaya, Kisumu, Busia, Homa Bay and Migori said they were in the county to show solidarity with their candidate Ochillo Ayacko, and denied claims of voter intimidation.

Western MPs hit back over plans to kick them out The mini-poll, however, was dogged by claims of bribery. It registered a low voter turnout. Eddy Oketch, a Federal Party of Kenya candidate in the by-election, claimed ODM leaders were intimidating his supporters and said he had reported the matter to the police. “I don’t understand this. Why has ODM sent hundreds of its MPs, officials and MCAs to Migori and yet the campaign window ended on Friday? What are all these people doing here if not to intimidate my supporters?” Mr Oketch asked. Those monitoring the elections included Busia Woman Representative Florence Mutua and Mathare MP Antony Oluoch. Ms Mutua, Nominated Senator Rose Nyamunga and Awendo MP Walter Owino led a monitoring team in Awendo while Mr Oluoch and Nyatike MP Tom Odege were in Nyatike. Mutua told journalists there was nothing sinister about their presence in Migori. “We are here to show solidarity with our candidate. Only that.” In the afternoon, there were reports that police had arrested an MCA allegedly found bribing voters in West Kanyimach ward. It was not immediately clear which party he belonged to. Spot checks in a number of polling stations, especially in Uriri Constituency, the home turf of embattled Migori Governor Okoth Obado, revealed a low turnout. ALSO READ:

It’s D-day for Migori poll Presiding officers and polling clerks basked in the sun as they waited for voters, many who were glued to televisions in shopping centers, to show up. Mr Obado and his two aides were yesterday charged afresh with two counts of murder; that of Rongo University student Sharon Otieno and her unborn baby. Obado’s bail application was pushed to October 12. Uriri MP Mark Nyamita shuttled from one polling station to another, urging voters to come out and exercise their democratic rights. In some stations like Awendo, Suna East and Rongo, the turnout was better than that in Uriri, Kuria West and parts of Nyatike. Each of the ODM MPs had been tasked to deliver not less than 70 per cent of registered voters in their turfs. Rongo has 48,412, Awendo 48,293, Nyatike 61,477, Suna East 46,534, Suna West 46,030, Uriri 51,676, Kuria West 51,057 and Kuria East 35,154.
