If found culpable, he will get punished. We are also engaging to find out who were the officers at the various road blocks and if any of them allowed the bus to proceed despite flouting traffic rules,” said Boinnet. Speaking during a press conference at the National Transport and Safety Authority (NTSA) offices yesterday, the IG said the bus was not licensed to operate at night. He revealed that the bus was carrying 71 passengers despite having a licensed capacity of 62. “Whereas the bus had a valid day time service licence, it was not permitted to operate at night and was therefore operating illegally.
