Muigai went on, "Niliskia mlipuko na gari ikaanza kuchomeka.” (I heard an explosion and a fire broke out). A similar incident was witnessed in Kayole in 2015, when 15 passengers were injured. An explosive went off inside a matatu in Umoja. The occupants were burnt and hit by flying objects after the blast inside a Forward Travellers matatu headed for Kayole. The injured were taken to Mama Lucy Hospital with multiple injuries. Witnesses said they saw sparks of fire emerge from the matatu’s battery before a fire engulfed, accompanied by a loud blast.
