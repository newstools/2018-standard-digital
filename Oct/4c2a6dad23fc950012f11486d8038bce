Two MPs were yesterday released by a court so as to keep the peace between two warring communities. Francis Chachu Ganya (North Horr) and Ali Rasso Dido (Saku) were released by Milimani Law Courts Magistrate Kennedy Cheruiyot on a Sh1 million bond each with a Sh250,000 cash bail alternative.

Police detain two MPs over Marsabit clashes Mr Cheruiyot said the two lawmakers had initiated a peace process in Marsabit, adding that holding them in police custody as had been suggested by the State would jeopardise the process. The magistrate, however, gave the State the liberty to ask the court to lift the bail in the event conflict in the devolved region persisted. “What I got is that the two are at the centre of a peace and reconciliation process. They are committed to reconcile the two warring communities. Reconciliation is allowed in our Constitution hence the two should be released to continue with the process,” ruled Cheruiyot. The prosecution wanted the court to allow it detain the MPs at the Kileleshwa Police Station for 21 days to complete investigations. According to police constable Edward Mulongo, intelligence information pointed at the MPs as being at the centre of the skirmishes. Your opinion is valuable.

We urge the court to take judicial notice of the violence between the Borana and Gabra,” Cheruiyot was told. The court further heard that the Director of Public Prosecutions intended to charge Rasso with promoting war-like activities by supplying food, water and firearms to raiders on September 4.
