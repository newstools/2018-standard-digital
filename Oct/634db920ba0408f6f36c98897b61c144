Clergy: Graft suspects too have rights According to Trade Cabinet Secretary Peter Munya, most farm produce supplied to outlets such as supermarkets and other chain stores is not paid for promptly, leading to accumulation of money owed to farmers. “There are numerous issues touching on retailers. Farmers have been complaining of non-payment for products supplied. This challenge will soon be a thing of the past when we finalise the regulations,” said Mr Munya during a familiarisation tour of New Kenya Co-operatives Creameries (KCC) and Rivatex Company in Eldoret last weekend. He accused some retailers of taking advantage of farmers' efforts by engaging in speculative buying.

He said it would be impossible to ban imports but stressed the need to ensure that consumers were protected from sub-standard goods. “The Government cares about the consumer and wants to tighten standards besides providing value addition to protect local industries." Munya said the Government was keen on promoting pre-shipment inspection in the country of origin and was encouraging co-ordination between players.
