A man yesterday attempted to snatch a gun from an Administration Police officer guarding a business premise in Eldoret town. CCTV footage showed the man seated next to Sergeant Mercy Kipchumba outside the entrance to Kenya Power offices before he grabbed her MP5 sub-machine gun and attempted to shoot her. Eldoret West OCPD Zakaria Bitok said the assailant had posed as a customer before the grab attempt, adding that he struggled with the officer before making his escape on a waiting motorcycle.
