Kenya Forest and Research Institute (Kefri) are lobbying for lifting of ban on logging of an invasive species to control its spread.

In Marigat sub-county, Baringo,the mathenge tree has eaten up over 10,000 hectares and is still spreading, blocking waterways, irrigation schemes, grazing fields and farms. The weed is one of the top 100 invasive species globally ravaging arid and semi-arid areas of Ethiopia, Sudan, Egypt, West Africa, Australia and South America among other countries.

Some people who have been pricked by mathenge thorns have had their limbs amputated. Choge said Kefri was researching on how to control the spread of the weed. ALSO READ:

Researchers say mathenge pods are nutritious and can be milled and mixed with wheat flour to cook chapatis or mixed with molasses for livestock feeds. This, researchers say, will also help control the weed
