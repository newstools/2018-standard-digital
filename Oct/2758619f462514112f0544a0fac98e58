This came as authorities raised the alarm about some schools that were collecting money from parents purportedly to buy leaked exam papers. The Standard has established that the names of the schools have been forwarded to the Teachers Service Commission (TSC) for disciplinary procedures as preparations for the exams get underway. Sources at the Ministry of Education and the Kenya National Examinations Council (Knec) revealed yesterday that heads could roll even before the tests began. ALSO READ:
