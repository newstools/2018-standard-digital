In the previous policy, the Commission on Revenue Allocation (KRA) identified the criteria by focusing on legislated discrimination, geographical location, culture and lifestyle, external domination, land legislation and administration, minority groups, ineffectual political participation and inequitable government policies. Focus was also on poverty, food insecurity, poor infrastructure, poor governance and poor state of basic social services. The previous policy identified 14 counties, namely Turkana, Mandera, Wajir, Samburu, West Pokot, Tana River, Narok, Kwale, Garissa, Kilifi, Taita Taveta, Isiolo and Lamu which shared Sh11.8 billion. In the second policy, the number of counties has increased to 34 and they are set to share at Sh12.4 billion after the commission identified them as marginalised in different sectoralÂ  priorities including roads, health, education, water, and electricity as well as fund administration.
