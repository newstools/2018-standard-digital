Fresh evidence from Ugandan Government shows Wajir Governor Mohamed Abdi (Above) did not set foot in the country during the period he claims to have pursued his degree. Former Wajir Governor Ahmed Abdullahi attached in his further affidavit a letter signed by Ugandan authorities, a few days after the Supreme Court allowed additional evidence to the case challenging the governor’s election. The Supreme Court said it was satisfied that allowing additional evidence is not prejudicial to any party and will be in the interest of justice as the evidence is crucial in making a proper judicial finding as to whether the governor had the requisite academic credentials to vie for the post in 2017. On Friday, Abdullahi filed the further affidavit after reading Abdi’s supporting affidavit used in his appeal against the Court of Appeal’s decision that nullified his victory. “On October 17, 2018, I instructed my advocates to write a letter to the Permanent Secretary at the Ministry of Internal Affairs, Uganda, inquiring on the travel status of the petitioner (governor),” says Abdullahi. Abdi claims to have studied Bachelor of Business Administration under the in-service programme at Kampala University. “This is to inform you that we have established no record of travels into and out of Uganda during the said period from 2009-2012 as per details provided in your letter,” reads a letter signed by Uganda’s Undersecretary Lynette Bridget Bagonza on behalf of the PS.
