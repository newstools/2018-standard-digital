The commission further argues the county had no valid contract with the companies that received the payments. The commission’s lawyer, Francis Makori stated that there was were no tender bid documents and that signatures on the payment vouchers were forged. In addition, the commission states that county officials falsified tender committee minutes and that the Local Purchase Order lacked the requisite authorisation. But one of firms mentioned in the suit, Mediscope Agencies and its owner, Stephen Sanga have opposed the suit arguing that they were validly awarded the contract and supplied all the 6,000 nets. Through lawyer Esther Onsembe, they argued that the anti-corruption court has no jurisdiction to determine the dispute. Avoid fake news!
