Nyong’o ordered to include nephews in multi-million property In her judgement, Justice Thrispisa Cherere also revoked the administrative certificate that placed Prof Nyong’o (pictured) and Risper Nyagoy as the sole controllers of the expansive estate. Nyongo’s nephews, Geoffrey Omondi and Kenneth Odhiambo, had asked the court to have their families included in the list of beneficiaries. They argued that other family members were also left out. The property valued at about Sh200 million includes 100 acres in Miwani under a 99-year lease, parcels of land in Manyatta, Tamu and Milimani estates, and East Rata in Seme sub-county in Kisumu. It also includes another parcel of land with flats along Jogoo Road in Nairobi. Stay informed while on the go by subscribing to the Standard Group SMS service. Text the word 'NEWS' to 22840. In earlier proceedings, Nyongo and Nyagoy had objected to the inclusion of the two nephews, arguing that they were not beneficiaries of the property. Nyagoy, who also represented Nyong’o, told a Kisumu court that the omissions were not done in bad faith. But in her judgement yesterday, Ms Cherere said the grant that the two obtained to manage the property was obtained illegally. ALSO READ:
