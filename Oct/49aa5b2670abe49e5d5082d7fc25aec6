Unity, push for referendum dominate occasion meant to honour national heroes Central Organisation of Trade Unions boss Francis Atwoli said it was demeaning for organisers to deny Luhya leaders a chance to address the meeting. "They ignored the fact that these leaders played a key role in making the day a success, including mobilising residents to attend," said Atwoli. He added: "When national events are held in other counties, local leaders are allowed to address the people. Why was it different in Kakamega?" Only governor, Wycliffe Oparanya, had a chance to address the meeting. Other political heavies present ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi, Bungoma Senator Moses Wetang'ula, Devolution CS Eugene Wamalwa and Senate Speaker Ken Lusaka. Know if news is factual and true.

"Either Mudavadi or I should have been allowed to speak but they pretended the region does not have leaders," he said Lugari MP Ayub Savula said: "It was unfair for the Government to bring the function here then lock us out of the programme."
