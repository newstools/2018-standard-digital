In the survey conducted in 5,557 households in the 47 counties from September 18 to October 24 last year, 76 per cent of respondents said they did not receive services after refusing to pay a bribe. “The average times a bribe is demanded reduced to 1.57 times nationally from 1.66 in the 2016 survey.
