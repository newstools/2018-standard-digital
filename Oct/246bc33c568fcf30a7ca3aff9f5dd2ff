Fountains should be aesthetically pleasing and should factor in the five senses of sight, touch, taste, hearing and smell. Movement is created as the water falls and splashes provide visual coolness. Add texture using stone or tiles. Selecting a mosaic pattern will add colour and pattern to the fountain to make it interesting. Place river stone pebbles around the fountain for accent. Aquatic plants like lilies will bring more life to the water body as the flat leaves and flowers glide on the water. For special occasions and parties, place floating candles on the water to create a festive ambience.
