Regional economic bloc Bill gets nod Launching the system yesterday, Governor Mutahi Kahiga said they had found it necessary to look for other ways of raising revenue to plug a Sh160 million budget cut by the National Treasury. "The county government has generated an extra Sh117 million since the new financial year started and we hope to increase this amount through the NyeriPay system,” Mr Kahiga said. He said other than increasing efficiency in revenue collection, NyeriPay would seal corruption loopholes as county officials would no longer handle cash. “We will place NyeriPay machines everywhere, from the quarries to the markets, to reduce the temptation that comes with handling cash. You will just need to produce your card or pay through M-Pesa,” said the governor. Residents will use the system to pay for parking, hotel and bar licences, fines and county government housing.
