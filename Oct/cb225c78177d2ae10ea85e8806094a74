Khashoggi murder suspect linked to prince, ran killing on Skype Haspel flew to Turkey on Monday for what one source called a brief visit, three weeks after Khashoggi disappeared in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul and days after U.S. President Donald Trump asked Turkey to share evidence it had collected. Despite extensive news leaks alleging that Turkey has audio recordings documenting Khashoggiâ€™s demise, neither U.S. nor allied government agencies have been granted access as of late Monday to such evidence, Western security officials said. Saudi Arabia said on Saturday that Khashoggi - a U.S. resident, columnist for the Washington Post and critic of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman - died inside the consulate after a fight. U.S. and allied intelligence agencies possess little hard evidence as they examine what role the crown prince, 33, may have played, officials have told Reuters. Trump, who has forged closer ties with Saudi Arabia and the crown prince, last week said the United States had asked Turkey for any audio or video evidence.
