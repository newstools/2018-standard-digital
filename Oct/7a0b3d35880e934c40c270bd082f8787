 Police gunned down three suspected bank robbers and arrested a fourth one during a botched robbery in Kerugoya town on Sunday morning. According to County AP Commander Chacha Marwa, a night guard on duty noticed some strange movement within Fortune Sacco building located within the town centre and raised alarm which attracted the attention of police officers on patrol. “The officers surrounded the building and ordered the intruders to surrender, but the suspects came out firing indiscriminately,” the commander said.
