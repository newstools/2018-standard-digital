Ojaamong dares MCAs to impeach him The leader of majority, Laban Mukhwana (Bukhayo East), and the deputy speaker, Lawrence Okaale (Angurai North), said MCAs would work closely with the county chief. Mr Mukhwana denied reports that a meeting had been held to draft a motion to impeach Ojaamong. Mr Okaale said the MCAs who were sowing seeds of discord between the executive and the county assembly would be named and shamed. Mr Ojaamong, who was present when the leaders spoke at a church in Machakusi, Teso South, promised to work with MCAs for the common good of the residents. He said it was regrettable that a five-day that had been planned to discuss county business aborted last week, adding that he was confident that a truce would be reached.
