Saudi Arabia said on Saturday that Khashoggi had died in a fight inside its Istanbul consulate - Riyadh’s first acknowledgement of his death after two weeks of denials that it was involved in his disappearance. “We’ll find out what happened to the body before long,” the senior official said. “The DNA is being procured from within Turkey.
