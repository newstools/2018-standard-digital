Police shoot in the air, disperse demonstrating teachers Jane Muthoni (pictured) has been charged alongside Isaack Ng’anga with the murder of Mbuthi between November 6 and November 11, 2016 at Karakuta Coffee Estate in Juja, Kiambu County. Ms Mwaniki protested to the court after Muthoni’s lawyer sought direction from Justice Ngugi on an application they had made to have the defendant’s bond terms reviewed. The prosecutor said they had been in court on two occasions where the case had failed to proceed for hearing after Muthoni claimed she was unwell. In the last adjournment on October 19, the State presented three witnesses who never got to testify after Muthoni claimed she was sick and the judge ordered that she be escorted to a hospital to receive treatment. Mbuthi’s family had opposed Muthoni’s application, claiming that she was feigning illness. But the judge said he would give her the benefit of the doubt. Know if news is factual and true.
