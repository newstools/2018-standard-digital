Kenya Red Cross to help mudslide victims Kenya Red Cross Society Secretary General Abbas Gullet said 37 permanent and semi-permanent houses would be built at a cost of Sh40 million. Mr Gullet, who was speaking at Solai trading centre in Subukia on Wednesday when he met the beneficiaries of the proposed houses, said a tender would be issued soon. According to the official, the house designs had been developed and approved by the Nakuru County government, which had partnered with the society to help the 223 vetted victims rebuild their lives. The organisation is also in the process of rehabilitating a borehole at Solai Nyakinyua Primary School. Solar panels will be installed so that water supply is restored in a week's time. Gullet said it was unfortunate that victims were still facing challenges five months after the tragedy. He expressed regret that due to interference by local leaders, some non-governmental organisations had stopped assisting the people who were the worst hit by the tragedy.
