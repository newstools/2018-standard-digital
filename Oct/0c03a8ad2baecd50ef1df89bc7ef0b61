Uber has introduced a new option for customers in some US cities - a monthly fee. Uber's Ride Pass has a number of interesting options, but customers have to pay USD14.99 per month to access them. Passengers in Los Angeles, Austin, Orlando, Denver, and Miami will have the option to pay each month for discounts on rides. Uber says this will save riders 15 per cent on their monthly spend with the firm. ALSO READ:

Why ‘mkokoteni’ should keep economists awake Of course it will benefit people who use the service multiple times a week, rather than those who missed the last train after staying in the pub for "just one more".

For example, if it's raining then Uber obviously gets busier and that's when you'll see a surge multiplier appear in the app. Likewise, late journeys often attract a surge to entice drivers to jump in their cars and start working.

In cities, when congestion charging, parking fees and general stress are taken into account this might make sense for some people. Drivers, the company says, won't see a change in what they earn. This means that Uber is bearing the cost, something that irritates London's cabbies no end. ALSO READ:
