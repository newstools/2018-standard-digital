A clinical officer is facing imprisonment after a court found him guilty of demanding Sh25, 000 from a relative of a patient in January 2014. Stephen Omoro, who works at the Kisumu East Hospital, had been charged with two corruption-related counts, including receiving bribes to facilitate blood transfusion. On Tuesday, Chief Magistrate Julius Ngarâ€™ Ngar ordered Omoro to pay a Sh100, 000 fine or be jailed for one year. Omoro was arrested by anti-graft detectives who laid a trap on a day he received Sh3, 000. ALSO READ:
