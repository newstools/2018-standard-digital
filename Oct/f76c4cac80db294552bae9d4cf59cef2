Officers toured the scene and confirmed that indeed he had been injured,” said OCPD Shimoli. A section of the 2,000 members of Olarro Group ranch which owns the 30,000-acre conservancy claimed three years ago they were ‘duped’ into signing a 15-year lease with Olarro Company Limited - an investor who established a wildlife conservancy without properly-laid out clauses.
