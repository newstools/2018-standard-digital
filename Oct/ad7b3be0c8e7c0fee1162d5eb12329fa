Sh300m housing project 'to delay' It covers old and new Ngara, Pangani, Jeevanjee-Bachelors, Ngong Road Inspectorate staff quarters, Uhuru andÂ  Suna Road. The entire project seeks to put up 200,000 affordable houses. Speaking during Mashujaa Day celebrations in Pumwani on Saturday, Sonko said the new houses would not attract any new charges and that current tenants would be compensated before moving out. Numerous hitches have caused the project's delay.
