Senators have unanimously supported a petition seeking to compel the Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) to come up with a currency that is friendly to visually-impaired persons. Senator Isaac Mwaura (nominated) introduced the petition in the House yesterday, a few days after the Court of Appeal gave CBK the green light to print new generation bank notes. ALSO READ:

He wants policies that govern the printing of currency to take into account the welfare of those who have challenges with their sight. “The visually-impaired and blind cannot differentiate by way of touch/feel the currency being used in Kenya. This has been a major setback to their ability to transact business freely,” said Mwaura. Leader of Majority Kipchumba Murkomen (Elgeyo Marakwet) and Leader of Minority James Orengo (Siaya), supported the petition, saying it could not have come at a better time considering that CBK was preparing to print new notes. “CBK has no option but to incorporate features in the new currency that are friendly to persons that live with visual disabilities. This is the only way the special group can feel like part and parcel of the rest of the country,” said Mr Murkomen. Mr Orengo said countries in the West used currency that could be easily distinguished by persons with sight challenges.
