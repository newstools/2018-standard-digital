The county government has restored water supply to villages and schools in Kerio Valley. Heavy rains between March and July washed away the pipes of the Katumoi-Koimur community water project, cutting off supply to families in Kibigor, Kabirokwo, Owak Katimoi, Kimuloi, Koimur, Kapkaya and Muguswo villages. Katumoi, Kibirokwo, Kibigor, Katabei, Kimuloi, Koimur and Munyek primary schools were also affected. The water project, which cost Sh30 million, was launched by former President Daniel arap Moi in 2003. The county spent Sh20 million from the emergency kitty to restore the water supply.
