 The Government’s constant shifting of goal posts in regard to paying maize farmers, particularly in the Rift Valley, is not reassuring. Several months after farmers sold maize to the National Cereals and Produce Board, no payment has been forthcoming. ALSO READ:

Shrinking land forces farmers to be smarter This has been so despite assurances from Mwangi Kiunjuri, the Cabinet Secretary for Agriculture, that have so far not been honoured. As a matter of fact, we are several weeks past the period within which, as Kiunjuri promised, the farmers were expected to have received their dues. It hurts farmers more because cartels that delivered cheap maize imported from Uganda were paid instantly, and at prices that defy logic. Members of the Senate who recently had a chat with farmers in Eldoret found it tough convincing them that the Government was concerned with their plight, at least not when all farmers got were insincere promises. The President’s tough speech and warning to the Agriculture CS while officially opening this year’s Nairobi International Trade Fair might just as well have been for show. More than a week after the warning, and the Agriculture CS having again assured farmers there was money to pay them, nothing has been done. Instead, the Government now tells farmers it will pay them all in the next one month. Running farmers through endless circles will not help. These excuses must stop. Farmers deserve to be paid what is due to them now, not a day later. It is impossible to understand how demoralised farmers can contribute to food security in Kenya.
