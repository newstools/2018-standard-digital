Passaris had also accused the governor of locking her out of key decisions about the welfare of city residents. She claimed the governor had not been inviting her to important events and that he had also ignored all her proposals meant to better the county. The proposals, she said, included one for City Hall to work with an investor from The Netherlands to put up a Sh10 billion recycling plant, where more than 40,000 youths would get jobs.
