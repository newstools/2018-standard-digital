Senator Moses Wetang’ula has denied that he plans to support Deputy President William Ruto in the 2022 presidential elections. Speaking in Busia during a funds drive on Sunday, Mr Wetang’ula said he shelved his presidential ambition in favour of Orange Democratic Movement (ODM) leader Raila Odinga in 2013 and 2017 but would be on the ballot in 2022. Wetang'ula said Raila must support him in 2022. ALSO READ:
