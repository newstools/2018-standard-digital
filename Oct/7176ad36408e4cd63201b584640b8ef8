The High Court has dismissed a case filed by the Turkana governor seeking to quash a report on alleged misuse of Sh14 million in the county. Josphat Nanok (pictured), who had sued alongside the county’s finance executive, Paul Nabun, claimed the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission (EACC) report handed to President Uhuru Kenyatta on matters that were under investigation was defamatory and exposed him to public ridicule.

In the report, EACC said it was investigating Mr Nanok over Sh14 million that was meant to build a bridge. High Court Judge Edward Muriithi said the governor had jumped the gun as the report did not insinuate he or the CEC were guilty of impropriety. Published reports “The petition was filed prematurely, before investigations into the matter and conclusive report made in accordance with the Constitution and statute. The disclosure of the report by the media did not per se violate the rights of the petitioners. It would only amount to such violation if it were suggested in the said published reports that the petitioners were guilty of the impropriety subject of the complaint,” ruled Justice Muriithi.
