Learning has been disrupted at Witharaga Primary School in Suna East Constituency after strong winds blew off the roofs of three classrooms. Pupils in Standard Six, Seven and Eight were forced to take their lessons under trees. Headteacher Jacob Mbicha said the winds also weakened other classrooms’ roofs and destroyed some toilets. “We are very lucky the incident happened yesterday (Thursday) evening when the pupils were at home,” said Mr Mbicha. “My worry is how these pupils will continue with their learning because the rainy season has just started. The pupils are also preparing for their end-year exams,” he said. Mr Mbicha said the school has 340 pupils who are all affected. He said if the classrooms are not repared before the exams begin then the pupils will be in a dire situation. One of the members of the school’s Board of Management, Denis Kaunda, said they have reported the incident to the Ministry of Education. “We have been told to write a letter requesting for emergency funds from the ministry,” said Kaunda. He appealed to well wishers and the entire community to help the school rebuild the destroyed classrooms as the pupils prepare for their exams.
