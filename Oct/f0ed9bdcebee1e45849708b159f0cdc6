Man shot dead in land dispute Mary Wairimu Dames won the case against Langata Development Company in the Court of Appeal. The judges ordered the firm to re-transfer the 85.3 acres of land near Thika–Garissa Road to her. The widow owned the prime land located east of Thika and known as Mary Dale Farm. It measures 1,062 acres. She sold part of it in 1989 to the land buying company.
