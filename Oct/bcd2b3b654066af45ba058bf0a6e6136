Kakamega man convicted for murdering grandmother Government pathologist Dixon Mchana told court the victim had a deep cut on her forehead. Dr Mchana concluded the cause of death was head injury. He also said there was evidence of sexual assault. Justice Ruth Sitati said the prosecution had proved the case of murder against Masiko beyond any reasonable doubt. Justice Sitati noted Masiko fled after his grandmother's body was recovered, only to re-appear for her burial, five days later. Alhough the prosecution relied on consequential evidence, since there was no eye-witness, the judge said the evidence was sufficient to place the accused at the centre of the felony. “The accused is the one who lived with the deceased and when she disappeared, he was seen coming out of her house. When he was asked about her whereabouts, he spoke with a certain degree of certainty, that she had gone to treat some children,” Justice Sitati said in her judgement read by Justice William Musyoka. She added: “In my view, he had a duty and in his own interest, to explain how she died. Having failed to do so, the only inference this court can make is that he knew she had died.” ALSO READ:
