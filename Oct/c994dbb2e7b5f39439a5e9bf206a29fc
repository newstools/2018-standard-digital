The area, about 250 km (155 miles) from the capital, Kampala, is close to the border with Kenya and is prone to landslides, suffering a major avalanche in 2010 that killed at least 80 people. Relief teams are now combing the area to search and rescue survivors, Owor said. “There are people who were displaced and they need shelter, food and all other support and we’re moving that relief to the area.” Avoid becoming a victim of Fake News.
