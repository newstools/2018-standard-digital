Deputy President William Ruto used the title deed of the Weston Hotel land as security to borrow over Sh1.3 billion from two banks. Mr Ruto first borrowed Sh100 million from Equity Bank in 2011, before turning to Kenya Commercial Bank (KCB), where he borrowed a total of Sh1.25 billion in 2014 and 2015 using the same title. Some of the money received from KCB was used to repay the outstanding loan at Equity. ALSO READ:
