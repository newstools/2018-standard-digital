A directive by Governor Godhana Dhadho for a headcount to unmask ghost workers has caused panic among county employees. Workers below the position of county director have been ordered to appear before a new vetting team with their letters of appointment and school certificates today. Several workers, who requested anonymity, told the governor to spare them.
