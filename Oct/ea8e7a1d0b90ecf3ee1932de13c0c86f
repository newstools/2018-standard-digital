But the Pride Inn Hotel and Investment Limited Chief Executive officer Mr Hasnain Noorani dismissed the claims saying they bought the parcel after carrying out due diligence in 2015 and that there was no dispute. He dared the directors of Shaana’s Boutique to follow the legal channel insisting that he was in possession of a genuine title deed and all the right documentation after following procedure in acquiring the property. “I have the title deeds to the property. I have all the documentation in place. If these people have owned the land since 1987, then where have they been? They just called me but I do not know them. Let them follow the legal channel,” Noorani said. Shaana’s directors’ claim their land has been amalgamated with a public access road to the beach after undergoing several changes creating plot MN/1/18253 that was registered on September 12, 2011 as CR 53290 o October 14, 2011.
