The 2TS Sacco matatus, which ply the two routes, kept off the roads on Tuesday over alleged harassment by traffic police officers. Moses Ngaruiya, a conductor, accused the officers from Thika police station of arbitrary arrests and extortion. "The officers demand money and those who refuse to give the cash are arrested," he said. Antony Muraya, a driver, said it was increasingly becoming difficult to operate in the routes due to harassment by police. Area traffic boss Hellen Wamuyu said they would not tolerate corruption on roads, which she blamed for an increase in road accidents.
