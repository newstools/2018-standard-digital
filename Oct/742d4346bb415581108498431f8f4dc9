As the deputy president, there is no specific duty attached to the office that William Ruto occupies today. However, there is a budget allocated to the office that can be used for the public good. Ruto deputises for the President and he has every right to visit the country to see for himself, first hand, what is actually going on at the grassroots or what really needs to be done and inform the Head of State. He needs to confirm that projects started by the Government are actually being done satisfactorily. ALSO READ:

Raila out to destroy Jubilee, Ruto says Of course, there are rank and file officers who can give him the information, but a good leader is one who interacts one-on-one with his people, which Ruto has been doing in the recent past. I do not see anything wrong with that, but coming from a society that eats, sleeps and walks politics, people are bound to draw their own conclusions from Rutoâ€™s visits across the country. In most cases, such conclusions are ill-informed. Thus, while any politician worth his salt would not let an opportunity to boost his or her profile pass, I believe Ruto has not specifically been on the campaign trail. Granted, he talks a lot about 2022, but so do a lot other politicians across the political divide. Would that therefore mean everyone who talks about 2022 is campaigning in the real sense of the word? Mr Kogo comes from Nandi County Avoid becoming a victim of Fake News.
