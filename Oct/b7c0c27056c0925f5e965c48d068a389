 A college plans to soon start manufacturing beauty products using locally available farm produce to create job opportunities and lower operation costs in salons. The Wanjau Technical and Vocational Training Institute has said it will soon set up a manufacturing arm that will buy sisal, avocados, macadamia, aloe vera and eggs from farmers to be used to produce hair and skin products for its salons. The institute’s director, Agnes Ireri (pictured), said several tutors had been enrolled to teach the manufacture of beauty products. “We use imported beauty products which are costly. Our plan is to make quality but affordable products,” said Ms Ireri on Monday.
