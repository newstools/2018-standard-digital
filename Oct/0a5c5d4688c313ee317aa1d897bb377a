Justice Musyoka said Malanda’s was a case of single eye-witness. A juvenile recognised rather than identify him. “I am fully satisfied that it is only the accused who has the key for unlocking the mystery surrounding the deceased’s death. I find there was malice aforethought since he knew his actions of strangling the deceased would cause death or grievous harm,” said Musyoka.
