The county assembly held its first ever sitting outside its chambers yesterday. The sitting, also known as 'Bunge Mashinani', was held at Kithimani Stadium in Yatta and was presided over by Speaker Florence Mwangangi. Several Bills were debated including one proposing the construction of bus parks in various urban centres. Ms Mwangangi said such sittings were meant to enhance the realisation of devolution goals, including public participation. "Sittings outside the chambers are meant to enhance participation of residents in legislation."
