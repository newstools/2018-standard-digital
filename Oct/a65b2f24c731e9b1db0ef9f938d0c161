 I would say yes. Â We are living in a modern world that demands we keep in sync with the latest trends to stay relevant in virtually all fields of life. For the longest time now, our police officers have been using guns that are clearly outdated; procured in the 1970s and are likely to malfunction in the heat of things, thus exposing our law enforcers to danger.

Why bodabodas are now number three in threat to national security These old G3 guns are slow loading, which means the police are greatly disadvantaged if they chance upon thugs sporting AK 47 riffles. The latter are automatic and accurate at long ranges unlike the G 3 riffles that are only good for short ranges. It therefore becomes dangerous for the police to try and sneak in close to someone with a superior weapon hoping to bring them down. Automatic rifles with telescopic sights not only accord the police a level of safety, they will definitely turn the tide against cattle rustlers, especially. Cattle rustlers have perfected the art of using terrain that police vehicles cannot use. Thus, with snipers strategically placed during an operation, rustlers will be in for a rude shock. Fighting terrorists is mostly psychological. As such, when lawbreakers have something to worry about, they will become less bold. None of them will be willing to find out firsthand how effective the new guns are going to be. The specifications they read about are enough to keep them guessing, maybe even make them realise the futility of crime. Mr Rotich works with Wells Fargo Avoid fake news!
