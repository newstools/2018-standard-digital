Researchers at the US National Library of Medicine recommend that ‘no selfie zones’ be introduced at dangerous spots to reduce deaths. These would include the tops of mountains, tall buildings and lakes, where many of the deaths occurred. Drowning, transport accidents and falling were found to be the most common cause of death.
