Communal violence in the northern Nigerian state of Kaduna over the last few days has killed 55 people, the local police commissioner said on Sunday.

He did not give details on the cause of the conflict but tension and clashes along ethnic lines have plagued that part of the state in the last few years. ALSO READ:
