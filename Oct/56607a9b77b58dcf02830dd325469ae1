It says that revenue growth in the year was constrained by the depressed economic environment, poor hydrological conditions in 2017 and the protracted electioneering period. “This slow business environment led to a significant decline in the company’s financial performance, in addition, increased financing costs and delayed review of retail electricity tarrifs led to reduced earnings.” Acting Managing Director Jared Othieno said the company has taken decisions which include the revision of corporate strategy, diversification of existing revenue streams and engagement with stakeholders to put the firm back to sound financial health. The profit warning means that the utility firm now expects to post a net profit of at least Sh5.45 billion, compared to Sh7.27 billion posted in June last year. Avoid becoming a victim of Fake News.
