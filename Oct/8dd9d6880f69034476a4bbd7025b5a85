Dr Kipsang said the textbooks were part of Seqip, which targets 7,852 primary and 2,147 secondary schools in 110 sub-counties in 30 counties in marginalised regions. The PS said under the project, Class Seven and Eight, as well as Forms One to Four in targeted schools would be given textbooks for core subjects with the objective of reaching a student-textbook ratio of 1:1. "The Government is implementing the project in conjunction with World Bank and focuses on improving retention of learners in primary education as well as transition to secondary education in arid and semi-arid regions," he said. The PS said he was satisfied with the book distribution, saying it would help address deficiencies and inequalities hindering teaching and learning in identified regions. Your opinion is valuable.
