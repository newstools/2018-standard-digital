Two schools on the West Pokot and Elgeyo Marakwet borders have been merged. Kipsitona Primary School in Tabach ward, West Pokot, was closed in July after bandits attacked a nearby village, killing two people and stealing livestock. The school has been merged with Kamelei Primary School to allow KCPE candidates to prepare for the examinations. ALSO READ:

I am satisfied that they will do the exams like other students in the country,” said Mr Chemekuro. He added that 100 pupils from his school had joined Tabach Primary School because they could not walk 15 kilometres to Kamelei. The Kamelei head teacher, Solomon Kiplagat, said student population had dropped in the past four months.
