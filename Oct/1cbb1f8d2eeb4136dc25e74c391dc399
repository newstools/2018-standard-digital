Kalonzo’s pledge: I’m willing to work with Ruto "We support establishment of the Standard Gauge Railway (SGR). However, we are concerned that the Government appears to have forced the project on the people," said Baya. He added: "SGR is wonderful. But we are also concerned that it has plunged over 1,000 drivers into joblessness since many passengers are now using the new train. Cargo is also being transported to Nairobi by the SGR." Baya claimed some towns that were supporting the economy of the region are dying after emergence of SGR.
