The High Court has thrown out a case filed by a businessman against President Uhuru Kenyatta’s kin over a Sh122 million land in Karen. Justice John Mativo in his judgment in favour of Uhuru's late step-sister Margaret Wambui Kenyatta’s grandson Njomo Kamau, found that his accuser, James Njoroge, had not brought a case that would move the court to kick Njomo out of the land.

Kenya's sad tale of the haves and have-nots The land in question initially belonged to Mr Njoroge’s late parents, Joseph Njuguna and Felista Wanjiru. According to him, sometime in 1986, his mother allegedly transferred the property into her own name and subsequently sold it to third parties. The buyers included Wambui, Peter Ngare, James Macharia, Nancy Mugechi, Peter Muchiri, Theresia Wairimu and Kagiri Ndirangu. Gunpoint The court heard that Njoroge was given Sh100,000 by his late mother after agreeing to withdraw a similar suit he had filed in 1993. Njoroge, however, had claimed that he was forced to withdraw the case at gunpoint. Your opinion is valuable.

He further told the court that Njoroge could not raise a claim to the land because his late father, Njuguna, left his late mother and their lawyer, Mohamed Khan, as executors of his will. Mr Khan, who filed a reply in the case, told the court that the late Njuguna had divided his land among his children during his lifetime but had not transferred all the documents. ALSO READ:
