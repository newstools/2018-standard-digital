 Police have arrested two people masquerading as veterinary officers in Thika East. According to police, the suspects were arrested in Gatuanyaga village at the weekend while vaccinating cows and goats. The two claimed they had been dispatched to the area by the national government following a disease outbreak among domestic animals. Residents recovered fake identification cards, an old thermometer, injectable animal drugs, needles, syringes and 2kg of salt lick. At Kamau Kuru’s homestead, his daughter, who is a veterinary officer, became suspicious when she saw how the suspects were dressed and the implements they were using. “My daughter told me doubted that the two were vets. She told me to call the police so they could help us to verify who they were,” said Mr Kuru. Stay informed while on the go by subscribing to the Standard Group SMS service.

Salome Wanjira, a resident who claimed to be a victim of the two, said they recently vaccinated her three goats at a cost of Sh1,000. “They vaccinated my neighbour’s goat but it died moments later,” said Ms Wanjira.
