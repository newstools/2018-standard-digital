Kitale Prison marked the 16th International Day against the Death Penalty with calls for more acceptance of former prisoners. The officer in-charge of Kitale Women's Prison, Lydia Ngeiywa, and the regional coordinator of the Kenya National Human Rights Commission, Kibet arap Kurgat, appealed to the public to treat former prisoners without suspicion. They said isolating former convicts made them feel insecure. They said some former prisoners had secured skills that could serve the society well.
