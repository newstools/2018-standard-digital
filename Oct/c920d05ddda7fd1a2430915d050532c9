A top leader of Rwanda's unregistered political group has escaped from prison. Authorities said Boniface Twagirimana of FDU-Inkingi was awaiting trial for allegedly forming a terror group. Mr Twagirimana, who had been in jail for one year pending trial, escaped from Mpanga prison in southern Rwanda on Sunday night along with another inmate, spokesperson of Rwanda Correctional Services Hillary Sengabo told a media briefing in the capital Kigali on Monday.

The duo jumped over the perimeter wall to flee the prison, he said.Â  The other escapee was Aimable Murenzi, who was serving a life sentence over aggravated assault with intent to kill and had served 11 years in jail, according to him. Twagirimana was arrested in September 2017 along with about nine others in connection with the formation of an armed group called P.5, which is said to be operating in the Democratic Republic of Congo, the Rwandan police said last year. Three inmates escaped from the same prison last year, including radio journalist Cassien Ntamuhanga, who had been charged with terrorism-related charges, according to Rwanda Correctional Services. The escape comes weeks after the early release of Victoire Ingabire, the head of Twagirimana's political group. She was pardoned by Rwandan President Paul Kagame with over 2,100 other inmates.
