NAIROBI, KENYA: Vivo Energy reported on Thursday a drop in third-quarter gross cash profit, hit by a slowdown in retail volume due to short-term supply disruptions in Kenya, Uganda and Ivory Coast. The company, which distributes and markets Shell-branded fuels and lubricants in Africa, said gross cash profit fell to $167 million in the quarter ended September 30, from $171 million a year earlier.
