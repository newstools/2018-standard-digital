According to Ernest Mwendo, the project's deputy coordinator, the first phase of the training will be undertaken in the next five years. “We are mainly targeting maize and beans inter-cropping, tomatoes, potatoes and milk production," he said. The project will also help connect the farmers to markets. According to Mr Mwendo, the World Bank has already sunk Sh56 million in the project. County Agriculture Executive Evalyn Koiyan described the project as a milestone. "It will ensure that our farmers reap maximum profits through proper and modern agricultural technology,” she said. The county has large tracts of arable land. Besides livestock farming, its main cash crops are maize, wheat and barley. According to statistics from the agriculture department, maize and wheat production significantly dropped last year due to erratic rains, and is expected to rise this year. Avoid fake news!
