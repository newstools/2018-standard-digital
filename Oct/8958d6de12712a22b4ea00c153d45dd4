Mr Kazungu said the amount was later revised to Sh14 million, which he used to purchase a Range Rover. He further disputed reports that he failed to remit tax from the amount advanced to him, explaining that a total Sh2.4 million in taxes was withheld by the ministry. “On the January 16, 2016, I assumed the role of Cabinet Secretary, Ministry of Mining through a signed appointment letter that entitled me to a car allowance of Sh7 million.
