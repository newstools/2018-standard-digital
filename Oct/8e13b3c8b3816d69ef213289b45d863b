Treasury, MPs walk tight rope on Sh800b debt hole He made the remarks before the House Labour Committee when he presented a petition by the Kenyan Deaf Community on Tuesday. The lobby group wants the National Assembly to appropriate adequate funds to support the promotion and development of sign language. It further seeks to have health workers trained on sign language, as well as have the Judiciary hire the experts. The petitioners said there were few health workers who could communicate in sign language, thus making it difficult for the deaf to access healthcare services. “The use of the Kenyan Sign Language by health workers, for example, birth attendants and in the media when airing health advertisements such as polio campaigns, will enhance the right to health by the deaf and hard of hearing,” read the petition.
