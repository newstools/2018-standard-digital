He died on Tuesday morning after he was rushed to hospital from Nairobi West Prisons where he was serving his sentence. On May 15, 2018, John Gakuo and former Local Government permanent secretary Sammy Kirui were jailed for their role in the Sh283 million cemetery land scandal. They were sentenced to three years in jail and fined Sh1 million each for abuse of office and failure to comply with procurement rules in purchasing the land. They were convicted for their role in the multi-million shilling scandal that rocked City Hall between 2008 and 2009. Avoid becoming a victim of Fake News.
