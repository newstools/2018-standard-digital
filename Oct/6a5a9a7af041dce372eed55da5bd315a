The MP also called on the State to review the classification of the road to upgrade it from a Kenya Rural Roads Authority (KeRRA) property and place it under the Kenya National Highways Authority so it could be given priority in rehabilitation. “This road connects Homa Bay Town, Ndhiwa and Nyatike constituencies.
