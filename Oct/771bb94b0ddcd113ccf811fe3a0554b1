Speaking at a press briefing in Nairobi, Njagi cited a Grade Two textbook illustration of an MP visiting the school. “Teachers and learners are cheering. I saw a helicopter. It was flying low. It was flying just above the trees. ‘Our leader! Our leader!’ we shouted. It was our Member of Parliament. He travels in a plane. It belongs to him. The helicopter landed in our school playground,” the  text below a picture reads. “Three big cars arrived in our compound. They too belonged to him. He came out and greeted us. His wife waved at us. She had golden rings in her hand. He told us if we do well, he will give us a treat. He will lift us up the skies. I will try my best.”  Your opinion is valuable.

It should be looked at in the eyes of the child, not …the politician.” Njagi said the media blew the matter out of proportion and ignored facts. ALSO READ:

Njagi said the two are not part of the Kenyan curriculum. They are used in Ghana and the US. “Our heads are not for carrying loads. We have a lot of uses for our heads. This is not a Kenyan text book and is not used in our curriculum.”
