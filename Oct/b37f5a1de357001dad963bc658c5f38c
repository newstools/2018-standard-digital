Senators have resolved to summon the Murang’a governor to explain the water wars in the region. The governor will be questioned by the Senate Committee on Lands, Environment and Natural Resources, on the tug of war between his administration and water companies. Yesterday, the committee’s chairperson, Mwangi Githiomi (Nyandarua), said the senators were keen to know what informed Governor Mwangi wa Iria’s executive order directing residents not to pay bills to the Murang’a Water and Sanitation Company (Muwasco). Former Equity Bank chairman, Peter Munga, who chairs Muwasco, will also be invited to shed light on the crisis. “We will invite Governor Iria to explain to us the genesis of the fight. We will also meet Mr Munga as we seek to find a solution to the problem,” said Mr Githiomi. He spoke when the committee met Water CS Simon Chelugui yesterday. The CS told senators that Iria (pictured) had interfered with water services in the region and snubbed forums convened to address the problem. Know if news is factual and true.

He said it was wrong for thousands of people to suffer because of differences between individuals.
