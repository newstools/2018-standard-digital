Suba North MP Millie Odhiambo distributes title deeds to residents in Lwanda Nyamasare trading center in her constituency. [James Omoro, Standard] A legislator has accused some of her colleagues of inciting MCAs to cause chaos at the county assembly. Suba North MP Millie Odhiambo said some of the leaders had vested interests that were polarising the county assembly. Even though she did not mention names, Ms Odhiambo argued that the MPs were motivated by ill intentions of getting funds from the county assembly through the backdoor. Speaking at Kamasengre Primary School in her constituency on Sunday, the legislator said friction among MCAs was jeopardising service delivery. “The truth of the matter is that the chaos being witnessed among MCAs is as a result of rivalry over funds acquired through the backdoor. It is unfortunate that some of my colleagues are causing war in the assembly so that they can benefit from House funds,” she said. The legislator told her colleagues to stand firm and shame the MPs who were meddling in county assembly affairs. Your opinion is valuable.

We have been quiet for a long time; we want to expose them and stop their ill motives,” she added. The Anglican Church of Kenya bishop in charge of Southern Nyanza, James Ochiel, and the county Bunge la Wenye Nchi head Waler Opiyo also condemned the protracted wrangles. “Let our MCAs stop wrangles and serve the people,” Mr Ochiel said. Mr Opiyo said the wrangles were setting a bad precedent. “They should be role models. The wrangles portray them in bad light,” he said.
