The change of guard has seen the two former best friends turn to foes. ODM cancelled the election and called another on September 6 which the party also postponed indefinately. MCAs allied to Muok went ahead and conducted the election. ODM Executive Director Oduor Ong’wen later wrote a letter dismissing the election. Party Secretary General Edwin Sifuna also wrote letters to the MCAs who participated in the poll asking them to show cause on why disciplinary action should not be taken against them for going against will of the party.
