Mombasa Port receives one of the largest container vessels Senior Counsel Pheroze Nowrojee told a five-judge bench that neither the Kenya Ports Authority nor the Kenya Railways Corporation (KRC) had the mandate to sign such an agreement. Mr Nowrojee said that transporting the containers from Mombasa port to the Embakasi Container Freight Station (CFS) would lead to job losses for coastal residents. “How will Mombasa youths access employment if port jobs are moved to Embakasi CFS? Taking jobs away with impunity violates the youths’ rights to employment as enshrined in the Constitution,” he said. Nowrojee is representing William Ramogi, Asha Omar and Gerald Kiti who are seeking orders to compel the ministry of Transport to hand over port management to Mombasa County. The three assert that the county has lost business opportunities since the Standard Gauge Railway started transporting containers from the port to Nairobi.

The judges are expected to rule this Friday on whether to strike out the entire petition or allow it. ALSO READ:
