Has Uhuru Kenyatta betrayed Rift Valley? On Thursday, Mr Mbadi wrote to the Speaker notifying him of Mr Otieno's replacement with Highrise MCA Kennedy Oyugi and Mr Imwatok's replacement with Lower Savanna MCA Nicholas Okumu. Mr Mwaura wrote back saying that according to the Standing Orders, changes in House party leadership can only be communicated in writing to the Speaker by the Whip Mbadi's letter, he added, was not accompanied by minutes of the party’s resolution on the matter. Mwaura also pointed out that the assembly only recognised Nasa as the political entity with minority members in the assembly and not ODM, thus any leadership changes should be made by Nasa and not ODM. He cited a precedent set in the Senate by Speaker Kenneth Lusaka. Your opinion is valuable. Take this quick survey to help us improve the website and content
