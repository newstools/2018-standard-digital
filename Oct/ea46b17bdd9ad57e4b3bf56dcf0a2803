The girl reported that she also declined the principal’s offer to accompany him for a principals’ conference held in Mombasa few months ago. According to the student, the principal had resorted to intimidating her after she declined to give in to his persistent demands to sleep with her. Addressing the press at Tala Girls High School after holding a familiarisation and strategy meeting with primary school head teachers drawn from Kangundo and Matungulu sub counties, the TSC director revealed a decision had been arrived at to have the teacher interdicted. “We followed all the procedures and we were able to trace the student and her parents. A team was also dispatched to investigate the matter in the school. Out of the report, the recommendations were that the principal had a case to answer,” said Mukui.
