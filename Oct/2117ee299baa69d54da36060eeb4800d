Adopt new ways of interpreting official corruption in Kenya The Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission (EACC) has summoned County Assembly Speaker Morris Buluma (pictured) over chaos that rocked the house on Tuesday. The commission has also summoned seven MCAs over the chaos that saw Patrick Kamwessar, the county assembly clerk, and Finance Director Laban Atemba also ejected. The MCAs accused the two of incompetence and misuse of funds. Mr Kamwessar has been also summoned to appear before EACC. In a letter seen by The Standard, dated October 17 and addressed to Mr Buluma, EACC is demanding information and documents relating to the incident that saw him kicked out of office by the MCAs. The commission said it was investigating claims of bad conduct against the MCAs, who include Leader of Majority Joel Ongoro. Others are Joab Mwamuto (Sheywe Ward), Kevin Mahelo (Butali/Chegulo), Jacklyn Okanya (nominated), Kennedy Kiliwake (Sango), Rodgers Nato (Bunyala East) and Farauk Machanje (Isukha South). Efforts to reach Buluma and Kwamwessar for comment on the summons were unsuccessful.
