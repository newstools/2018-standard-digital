Sharon's foetus burial postponed Samburu Governor Moses Lenolkulal said performance of the village administrators would be measured according to the number of children enrolled in schools. He asked the administrators to partner with village councils to the work possible. “We have nursery schools and want our village administrators to move from one home to another to ensure not even a single child is not going to school,” said Mr Lenolkulal. The governor said the county government’s efforts to entice children to ECD centres had not yielded enough fruit. “We have built ECD centres and supplied free food to those centres so that children can go to school and learn. We have given ECD uniforms for free to attract children to ECD centres,” he said, adding that despite all the effort, some children were still out of school.
