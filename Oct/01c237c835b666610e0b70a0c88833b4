 Kenya Medical Services Authority (Kemsa) CEO Jonah Manjari on Friday revealed that counties owed Sh1.3 billion for medical drugs. Mr Manjari said most counties had not paid for drugs received since June 30, while others were yet to fulfil promises made in 2014 to pay up despite Kemsa supplying drugs and equipment to 98 key hospitals. According to a list seen by The Standard, Nairobi leads with a debt of Sh379 million, followed by Kilifi with Sh203 million. Nyandarua has the smallest debt at Sh34,000.
