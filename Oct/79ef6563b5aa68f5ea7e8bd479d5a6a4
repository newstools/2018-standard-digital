The duty that was supposed to be remitted to KRA was Sh16,755,079,433,” he said. Making submissions before the select Senate committee probing the maize crisis, Mr Gaichuhie said Treasury waived duty on the imports based on recommendations of the Ministry of Agriculture. Treasury CS Henry Rotich declared the waiver of duty for imports in a gazette notice published on April 13, last year. The importation period was from May to August 31, but was extended to September and later December 31, last year, leading to the saturation of the local market. Avoid becoming a victim of Fake News.
