The leaders led by party secretary general Nick Salat and Emurua Dikirr MP Johana Ng’eno said Kanu is an affiliate of the ruling Jubilee Party and there was no worry over government positions.

We saw CCM, PNU get something and we are yet to get anything but we hope we shall get something in the remaining positions,” said Mr Salat. Sponsored petition The secretary general passed greetings from the party leader Baringo Senator Gideon Moi to residents. Ng’eno accused some Jubilee leaders of sponsoring the election petition against him but said he was confident he would have been re-elected if the court had nullified his win. “After the Supreme Court nullified Uhuru Kenyatta’s win, he approached me to campaign for him and I did it whole-heatedly and he got over 22,000 votes in my constituency. I was however taken aback when I realised a petition against me had been filed by my Jubilee competitor,” he said. The MP thanked his lawyer Kimutai Bosek for putting up a spirited fight in court and asked President Kenyatta not to forget the Kipsigis in his Cabinet. He dismissed claims of bad blood with Deputy President William Ruto saying he was ready to work with him. ALSO READ:
