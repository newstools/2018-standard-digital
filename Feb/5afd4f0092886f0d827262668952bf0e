The manufacturers also complained about the high cost of power, which they said was pushing them out of business. They said the introduction of cheap power tariffs had yet to benefit them two months after the announcement by the Energy Regulatory Commission (ERC). “The problem we have in this country is that we have too much talk but less action. There is a lot of bureaucracy, which has made manufactures miss out on these benefits,” he said. ERC in December last year announced the introduction of discounted tariffs to large commercial and industrial power users. The night tariffs were meant to help promote commercial and industrial growth while maximising on the surplus energy available at off-peak hours.

Kieni MP Kanini Kega, the chairman of the Trade, Industry, and Cooperative Committee in the National Assembly, said his team would support any law to protect local manufacturers.
