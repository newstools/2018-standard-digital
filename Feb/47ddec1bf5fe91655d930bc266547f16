Governors strike deal to save new cabinets Kojwach MCA Joan Ogada, who allegedly grabbed the mace triggering the brawl, and her nominated counterpart, Evaline Otieno, are among the ward representatives the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission (EACC) has summoned. The officials have been ordered to report to the South Nyanza regional office in Kisii. The MCAs have been accused of violating ethics and integrity laws by fighting during the special session called by the speaker, Elizabeth Ayoo, to oust committee chairpersons and their deputies. Ms Ayoo claimed the changes were prompted by a directive from the ODM party. However, the ODM national chairman, John Mbadi, said the party had not issued any such orders. The EACC deputy chief executive officer, Michael Mubea, said the MCAs had been summoned because their actions were against the law. "The law stipulates that all State and public officers should uphold the highest standards of integrity and ethical conduct while undertaking their official duties," Mubea said. He explained that the allegations being investigating amounted to serious criminal offences and were a breach of the integrity and ethical codes of conduct. ALSO READ:
