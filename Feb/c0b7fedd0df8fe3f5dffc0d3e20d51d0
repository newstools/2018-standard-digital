After 30 years of waiting, members of the troubled Nanga-Kihoto Land Buying Company in Naivasha will go to elections tomorrow. The elections, which were ordered by the High Court, will pave way for the sub-division of the farmers’ 2,323 acres located off the Naivasha-Kirima road. The elections, which will be held in Gatanga Catholic Social Hall in Murang’a, come after a protracted court battle between members of the company. The polls come barely a month after the members petitioned the President to intervene over the prime parcel of land whose case has dragging on in the High Court. Outgoing officials welcomed the court order noting that this would give members a chance to exercise their democratic right. New officials Speaking ahead of the elections, Francis Muheria, a director of the company, said: “We are calling on all members of Nanga-Kihoto Land Buying Company to turn up in large numbers this Friday and elect their new officials,” he said. Mr Muheria said all was set for the elections which would culminate in the elections. “Some of the members have died while waiting for justice but we are happy that after years of waiting we are about to get a parcel of the land,” he said. Muheria noted that 456 acres of the farm were currently leased out to flower growing company. “Our members are ready to move into the land in Naivasha which they bought using coffee funds and start sub-dividing it after the AGM,” he said. “The land was bought back in the early 80s and some of the elderly members have died waiting for justice and some officers in the registrar of company are the stumbling block,” said Nanga-Kihoto chairman Samuel Monyo. The election of new directors was ordered by High Court judge Roselyn Korir.
