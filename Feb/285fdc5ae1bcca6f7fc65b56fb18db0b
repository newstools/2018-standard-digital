Extra-ordinary Council on Trade, Industry, Finance and Investment sitting in Arusha observed that the Trade and Investment Report 2016 indicates EAC Intra-trade has been declining since 2014 due to various factors which needed to be addressed. The decline in the trade levels was partly attributed to drop in aggregate demand levels associated with widespread drought in the region coupled with falling international prices for the main EAC exports. Total EAC imports fell by 24.6 per cent to $29.7 billion (Sh3 trillion) in 2016 from $39.4 billion (Sh4 trillion) in 2015. The fall in imports was mainly attributed to the fall in crude oil prices that could have reduced the import bill for petroleum products. As a result, the EAC Secretariat has been directed to among other measures undertake an in-depth analysis to identify the specific factors affecting trade flows in the EAC and determine the impact of the identified factors on the EAC terms of trade, investment and the competitiveness. “The secretariat will propose appropriate recommendations to revamp the EAC intra-trade and investment flows; assess the impact of non-tariff barriers (NTB) on EAC trade flows in quantitative terms and compile the Partner States’ comments to the EAC Elimination of NTB Act 2017 and expedite the amendment process of the Act,” noted the council. DOMESTIC TAXES Others are meant to convene a meeting of ministers and permanent secretaries to discuss the findings, challenges and provide strategic interventions to bolster the EAC intra-trade, investment and the competitiveness. It will identify areas distorting trade in EAC emanating from national policy actions including local content requirements and domestic taxes. ALSO READ:
