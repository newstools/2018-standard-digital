They have PhDs The Gem MP claimed there was a scheme by MCAs to frustrate some nominees. He said it was inappropriate for the Speaker to say some nominees were  not well educated yet most of them were PhDs holders. “We cannot delay development projects of Siaya County because of political games,” said Odhiambo. But the Speaker, who struck a re-conciliatory tone, said he was not at war with any elected leader. “I will not respond to any allegations or tongue lashing. I made a personal resolution that I will be a unifying factor in the county, “ said Okode. ALSO READ:
