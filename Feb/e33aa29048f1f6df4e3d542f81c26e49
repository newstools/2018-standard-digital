In the Environment Committee, Sophia Ali (Ijara) was declared winner to replace Kangogo Bowen (Marakwet East). She was voted by 13 out of 15 members, who participated in the election that the National Super Alliance (NASA) boycotted over what they termed as illegality and violation of Parliament's Standing Orders. NASA MPs who were supporting Mwingi North MP Paul Nzengu walked out after Jubilee brought in three none committee members to sit in for their colleagues who were absent. Parliament's Standing Orders state that a member who is outside the country on duties or is indisposed can ask a colleague to sit in for them. The three absent members were reported to be attending to sick relatives and other engagements. Majority Chief Whip Benjamin Washiali and Clerk of the National Assembly defended the decision to have the members participate in the election as their request had been approved by Speaker of National Assembly Justin Muturi. And on Tuesday, Joash Nyamoko (North Mugirango) was declared winner unopposed to chair Broadcasting and Library. ALSO READ:
