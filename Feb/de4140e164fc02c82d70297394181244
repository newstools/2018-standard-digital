The move by the senator comes in the wake of an outcry by area residents and leaders that they had not benefited from job opportunities and tenders since the project started. Speaking in Naivasha, Kihika accused the contractor of ferrying the same workers who had worked in the Mombasa route to Naivasha terming it unacceptable. “We are putting the contractor on notice that we shall not seat back and watch as he gives area residents a raw deal and we are demanding job opportunities for our youths,” she said.
