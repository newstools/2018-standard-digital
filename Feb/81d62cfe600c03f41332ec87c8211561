MOMBASA, KENYA: Technical University of Mombasa (TUM) has gone to court to block former vice chancellor Josephat Mwatela from auctioning its eight vehicles to recover Sh8.4 million deducted by the institution from his original compensation of Sh28 million for wrong termination. Mwatela began the process of attaching the vehicles valued at Sh7.3 million should the university fail to pay him the full sum as ordered by the court last year. ALSO READ:
