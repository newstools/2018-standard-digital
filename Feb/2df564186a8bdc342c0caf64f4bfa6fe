The court issued an arrest warrant after Nyakundi failed to appear to answer the charges. He requested the court to release him on a personal bond on the grounds that he had obtained an anticipatory bail of Sh100, 000 on January 30. Nyakundi claimed he had suffered at the hands of police officers, whom he said defied a court order to release him. He told the court that on January 30, he appeared before Justice Luka Kimaru and obtained an order for anticipatory bail. Kimaru had directed that Nyakundi should not be arrested or detained by the police pending investigations. However, the accused claimed that the police arrested him later that day and detained him at Kamukunji Police Station. The defence said Nyakundi’s rights were violated. ALSO READ:

However, he has now been formally charged and he is required to attend court,” said Wamulika. He asked that Nyakundi be restrained from using his social media accounts. “The accused should deposit Sh500, 000 bond plus one surety of similar amount and the matter will be heard on March 7, 2018,” Cheruiyot ruled.
