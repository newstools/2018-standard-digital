Others who had obtained the anticipatory bail of Sh100,000 were Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho, Homa Bay Woman Rep Gladys Wanga and NASA Chief Executive Norman Magaya. They were directed to go for questioning but detectives did not record any statements.

Their bonds were stamped and we left,” added lawyer Nelson Havi. There were fears the State could target the leaders for their roles in NASA chief Raila Odinga's 'swearing-in' last week.
