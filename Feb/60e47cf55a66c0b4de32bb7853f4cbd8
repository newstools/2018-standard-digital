Mandera hosts UN, WB, EU envoys in tour of Northern Kenya Army officers, friends and relatives who attended the burial in Oldany village in Narok West described Mr Nkanae as a patriotic, honest and hardworking officer who put his life on the line to defend the country. Army Commander Robert Kibochi described him as a diligent soldier and termed his death a blow to the country. The death of Nkanae, who was part of a squad sent to fight Al Shabaab militants in Somalia, happened just four months after his older brother fell and died in his bathroom. Interior Chief Administrative Secretary Patrick Ntutu said the Government would not relent in the war against terrorism. "The 14 years he served the country were not in vain. The Government will continue supporting his family," said Mr Ntutu. Nkanae is survived by a wife and four children.
