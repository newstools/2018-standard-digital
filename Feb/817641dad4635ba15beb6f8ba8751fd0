An Istanbul court ordered the continued detention of Taner Kilic, the head of Amnesty International in Turkey. This is in a dramatic reversal of its decision to release him into judicial control within 24 hours, which the rights group slammed as a "travesty of justice". Kilic has been held in the western city of Izmir since June 2017, accused of links with US-based preacher Fethullah Gulen.
