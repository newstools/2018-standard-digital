Ongeri said the petitioner failed to comply with court guidelines, hence the respondents did not have enough time to respond to issues raised. Albeity wanted the court to invalidate the results and order a fresh election. He also prayed for scrutiny and recount of votes in all polling stations in Lamu County to ascertain the number of votes cast. “The senatorial elections on August 8, 2017 were fair and held as per the law,” the judge ruled, adding that there were no irregularities that could have affected the outcome. She said IEBC, the returning officer, and the senator were not privy to the wrangles between Albeity and his party.
