Some 120 vulnerable households in the county are set to benefit from a Sh96 million housing programme. An organisation, Habitat for Humanity, in partnership with the county government, is initiating the housing programme that will see residents benefit from modern houses at a cost of Sh800, 000 each.

We are working hand in hand with local leaders to enhance our criteria of getting deserving beneficiaries,” he said. Mr Kiragu said Habitat for Humanity had constructed the first 20 houses in Rangwe, Ndhiwa and Mbita sub-counties. “The work remaining for other houses will commence in the next few weeks. We will also endeavour to increase the number of houses from the scheduled 120,” he said. Awiti promised to allocate a commitment fund in the 2018-2019 financial year budget.
