Kenya imports a large mix of goods from China, but the importation of Standard Gauge Railway equipment last year may have contributed to the surge in the value of imports. According to latest data from the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics (KNBS), the value of imports from China accounted for more than a fifth of goods imported to the country last year. Kenyans imported goods worth Sh1.725 trillion to December 2017, a 20.5 per cent growth compared to Sh1.431 in 2016. Of the Sh1.725 trillion worth of goods imported, KNBS data shows that 22.6 per cent (Sh390 billion) was from China. Chinese imports to Kenya have steadily grown and more than doubled over the past five years, growing from Sh167.2 billion in 2012 to last year’s Sh390 billion. Among the major imports from the country to Kenya are electronics, motorcycles, motor vehicles spare parts, furniture and clothes. Other than imports, China has a strong hold on Kenya in other areas, including being the single largest lender to the country, with debt owed to China currently at over Sh250 billion. ALSO READ:
