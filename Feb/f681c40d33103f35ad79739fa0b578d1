Moi mourns Billy Graham Admirers took photos on their phones while fire trucks parked on freeway overpasses and police officers saluted as a motorcade carrying the body of the Reverend crossed the evangelist's beloved home state of North Carolina for four hours, from his mountain chapel to the Billy Graham library in Charlotte. The hearse carrying the body of evangelist Billy Graham arrived at the Billy Graham Training Center at The Cove, where some of Graham's family members had gathered on February 22, 2018. A ceremonial procession for evangelist Billy Graham moved from Asheville to Charlotte, North Carolina, as spectators snapped pictures along the route. The motorcade rolled through Black Mountain, where he shopped and caught trains, to Montreat, where he lived. Reverend Billy Graham, the influential Southern preacher who became a spiritual advisor to several US presidents and millions of Americans via their television sets, died aged 99 on Wednesday last week. A viewing will be held at the library in Charlotte on Monday and Tuesday, while the private funeral service is set to be held on Friday, March 2. The invitation-only service is scheduled to include at least 2,300 people. Graham will also lie in honor in the U.S. Capitol Rotunda, the first time a private citizen has been accorded such recognition since civil rights hero Rosa Parks in 2005. ALSO READ:
