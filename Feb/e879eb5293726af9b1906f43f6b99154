Three children die after house catches fire Area Assistant Chief Washington Ireri said the children were declared dead after they were rushed to hospital. “When the house caught fire, they tried to escape but the metal door was too hot to touch. They suffocated near the door,” he said. The children's grandmother said she was woken up by screams at around 3am. She ordered the electricity switched off but by time the fire was put out, the children were in critical condition. Their children's aunt, Mercy Karimi, said Muthoni had just arrived home from school for the mid-term holiday.
