National Super Alliance leader Raila Odinga was among the thousands that gathered in Zimbabwe on Tuesday to bury opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai, an icon in country’s opposition politics and who lived to see the fall of his political nemesis Robert Mugabe. Tsvangirai died last Wednesday aged 65 at a South Africa hospital, where he had been undergoing treatment for colon cancer. ALSO READ:

In his eulogy Raila Odinga condemned political oppression in Africa. Like Tsvangirai, his electoral ambitions have been thwarted in controversial polls.
