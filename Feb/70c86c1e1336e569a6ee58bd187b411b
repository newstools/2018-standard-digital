NRM has about 132 offices across the country. "As we check on our policies, so many things are changing. So we also need to change the way we work," said Lumumba. All the workers were paid all their salary arrears as they wait for their contracts to expire on April 20. Lumumba said the movement had to fire the workers because the party did not have enough money to pay them. NRM gets $2.208 million (Sh221.5 million) annually from the state to run activities, but its current monthly payroll stands at $227,774 (Sh22.8 million).
