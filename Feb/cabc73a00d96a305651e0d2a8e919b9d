According to Chief Operating officer Andrew Dixon, the retailer will close the crucial Hyper Branch on Saturday (February, 24) as a cost management strategy. This was also confirmed by Sarit Centre management. In a statement to the press, the management said that it was looking at cost-effective retail space as it moves to streamline its store portfolio in line with the turnaround strategy. "Uchumi has been located at the Sarit Centre for over 30 years and we wish to thank the management for their support over the years and also grateful to all our loyal customers," said Mr Dixon. In what could point to more branch closures lined up, Mr Dixon added that the retailer will be exploring possible "relocation at other venues for our most unviable stores" to cost-effective locations.
