Jason Murimi, who is the complainant, said he was with his family, including a 10-year-old daughter, when the obscene music video was playing. “Inside, together with other passengers, we protested and asked the driver to stop playing the video but he refused. Imagine what my children saw. This is madness,” said Murimi. Kenya law prohibits exhibition of unclassified video content contrary to section 12 (1) and (2) of the Films and Stage Plays Act Cap 222.
