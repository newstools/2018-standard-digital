Mr Kaluma was with Kajwang’ when he was ordered to drive to the DCI offices by the arresting officers. The officers trailed him from the courts for what other officers said were grilling sessions. At the headquarters, a team of detectives has been set up to investigate alleged illegal activities that took place on Tuesday. The arrest came less than an hour after Interior Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang’i announced that the authorities were investigating the Uhuru Park events. “What was witnessed at Uhuru Park was a well-choreographed attempt to subvert or overthrow the legally constitutional government of Kenya,” Matiang’i said without elaborating.
