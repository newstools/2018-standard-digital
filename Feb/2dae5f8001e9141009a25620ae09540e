Taita Taveta leaders have asked the Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS) to halt translocation of elephants to Tsavo National Park immediately. Led by Governor Granton Samboja, MPs Jones Mlolwa (Voi), Danson Mwashako (Wundanyi) and Andrew Mwadime (Mwatate), they said they will not allow KWS to convert the region into a dumping ground for troublesome jumbos.

Tough job of moving jumbos Speaking separately, the leaders said the translocation of more elephants into the region will worsen the situation as the county is one of the worst hit by persistent human wildlife conflict in Kenya. On Wednesday, KWS started moving 20 elephants from Solio Ranch to Tsavo East National Park following persistent complaints from farmers who have lost their harvests to the roaming beasts. “This is the best way to address the issue,” said Tourism and Wildlife Cabinet Secretary Najib Balala while launching the drive at Solio. But Governor Samboja asked the CS to halt the exercise immediately and return the jumbos to Mt Kenya. “We will not allow rogueelephants here as this will worsen the situation here,” he said. Mlolwa, Mwashako and Mwadime urged the government to address the human-wildlife conflict in the county before translocating more jumbos to the region.
