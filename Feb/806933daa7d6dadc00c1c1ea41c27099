NAIROBI, KENYA: The UK government has issued a travel advisory to its citizens within Kenya and those planning to visit the country over what it calls 'political tensions' after last year's elections. The UK calls for caution and tells those visiting to avoid travelling around areas where demonstrations may take place. ALSO READ:

The demonstrations, it says, may include large gatherings at universities, political party headquarters and offices of the electoral commission. The advisory says bag snatching is common in transport hubs like bus and railway stations and airports. “Mugging, kidnapping, carjacking and armed robbery occur regularly, particularly in Nairobi, Mombasa and other large cities. Foreigners are not generally targeted, but incidents of violent crime have resulted in the death of several British nationals in recent years,” the advisory says. Crime rates It adds crime rates are higher in slum areas of Nairobi, Old Town of Mombasa and  around Likoni Ferry. Cases of mugging have been on the increase in Nairobi in the few past months in incidents blamed on hawkers, street families and political tension. ALSO READ:

If you’re attacked, don’t resist. Avoid walking around after dark, especially in isolated areas,” reads part of the advisory.
