Uganda joins several African countries that have sought to develop interest-free banking in recent years, including Nigeria, Morocco and Senegal. Despite small populations of Muslims, countries such as Uganda, Kenya and Ethiopia are also developing the sector to expand financial access and inclusion among rural communities. Islamic finance institutions operate according to religious principles that include a ban on paying interest and shun outright monetary speculation. In December, the central bank became an associate member of the Islamic Financial Services Board (IFSB), one of the industry’s main standard-setting bodies.
