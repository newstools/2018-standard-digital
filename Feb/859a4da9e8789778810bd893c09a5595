Additionally, it was hit with a financial penalty of Sh3.57 million. The money went to the Investor Compensation Fund. According to CMAâ€™s Collective Investment Schemes Regulations of 2001, it is the duty of a trustee to ensure that decisions about the constituents of the collective investment scheme portfolio do not exceed the powers conferred on the fund manager. Further, the book value of an investment in a financial institution is not supposed to exceed 25 per cent of the collective investment scheme portfolio and net asset value. Monthly payments Equally, British American Asset Management Ltd was disgorged of fees totalling Sh4.82 million, being cumulative monthly payments it had received for fund management services to Genghis Unit Trust. CMA found the firm to have breached regulatory requirements as a fund manager. According to the regulator, Britam Asset Management failed to exercise its duty of care towards Genghis by failing to decline the request of a promoter to invest more than the prescribed limit in Chase Bank.
