Shilling steady against dollar This is the strongest level that the shilling has risen in more than a year and last traded under Sh102 levels in December 2016. On December 6, 2016, the shilling traded at Sh101.87 against the US dollar. Healthy inflows According to a Reuters report, commercial banks quoted the shilling at between Sh101.80 and Sh102 per dollar during Thursday’s early morning trade. The shilling strengthened in January due to what CBK said were earnings by exporters. The local currency has also been boosted by inflows from investors looking to take advantage of a Sh40 billion infrastructure bond whose sale closed in the last week of the month. This week, traders attributed the strengthening of the shilling to healthy dollar inflows and banks cutting their long dollar positions. Dollar positions ALSO READ:
