Appearing before Chief Magistrate Francis Andayi last week, the two pleaded not guilty and were freed on a personal bond of Sh 20,000 each. It is alleged that the two assaulted one David Gichagu Wagana, a parking attendant at Fortis Towers compound in Westlands area in Nairobi on January 11, 2018. They are said to have committed the offence at a parking lot at Fortis Towers compound in Westlands, Nairobi, on January 11, this year. Through lawyer Harun Ndubi and James Orengo, Owino pleaded with the court to release him on free bond on grounds that the offence was petty. He also denied assaulting Gichagu on similar dates and place. He told the court he was being targeted due to political interests. “My client was arrested and put in custody for two days, which is illegal and a violation of his rights,” said Ndubi. At the same time, the magistrate directed the Divisional Criminal Investigation Officer Parklands to explain to the court why Owino had been in police custody for two days. ALSO READ:
