Ethiopia, noted Deloitte, was currently building the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam at a cost of Sh4.1 billion as well as the Kyosha Hydroelectric Dam at Sh2.8 billion. According to the International Monetary Fund, Ethiopia’s economy has overtaken Kenya’s with the former’s gross domestic product (GDP) - or the total value of goods and services produced annually - hitting Sh7.4 trillion in 2016 compared to Kenya’s Sh7 trillion. “They (Ethiopia) are doing really good. They have come from nowhere to somewhere in a relatively short space of time,” said Deloitte Africa Infrastructure and Capital Projects Leader Jean-Pierre Labuschagne.
