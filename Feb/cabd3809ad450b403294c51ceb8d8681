The former Kasipul MP told the court that he had a parallel tallying centre whose results revealed that he garnered 224,863 votes against Awiti’s 174,235 votes. IEBC however, announced Awiti the winner with 210,173 votes against Magwanga’s 189,060. Hitherto, Awiti has described the court’s decision as that made in favour of the highest bidder. “Today marks a very dark day for the residents of Homa Bay County who will has been sacrificed at the altar of corruption and incompetence within the ranks of our Judiciary,” Awiti said. He continued the attack on the Judiciary saying, “Our people queued for long hours and spoke loudly at the ballot on how they want to be governed for the next five years only for their will to be killed by the court.” Awiti however, maintains he will seek redress in the Court of Appeal after consultations as he had won the election fairly. Justice Joseph Karanja had ordered the electoral body IEBC to conduct a repeat election that meets the threshold set in the Constitution and election laws. ALSO READ:
