Chuka/Igambang'ombe police boss Barasa Saiya said the suspect was already arrested after the Thursday night's incident. Students from the institution who reside outside have protested the incident saying cases of insecurity were on the rise in the recent past. A second year Arts student Mr Abong'o Abong'o who spoke on behalf of the students said the issue of insecurity has been escalating and the worst thing was that the institution and the police department were not taking any serious action to curb this. He said many students have been mugged on their way to their hostels after classes and nobody has ever been arrested for this. Last year, he added, a female student was raped by his landlord and the institution kept numb about it. The case is filed in Chuka law courts. ALSO READ:
