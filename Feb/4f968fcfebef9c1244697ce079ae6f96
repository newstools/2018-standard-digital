Schools: Menengai win rugby, basketball Governor Wycliffe Oparanya attributed this partly to corruption among his officers in the revenue office. He said the cashless system would seal loopholes that had seen his government fail to meet its Sh1 billion revenue target last year, when it managed only Sh500 million. The governor said poor record keeping and lack of accountability also contributed to the revenue challenges. This has in turn affected service delivery, he said yesterday. "To address the challenges, I have restructured the county government by creating more departments that will improve revenue collection by sealing graft loopholes," said Mr Oparanya. He also reshuffled some of the officers in the audit department in a bid to boost service delivery. “There has been rampant corruption, a bad attitude towards work and dishonesty among county employees, which has posed serious challenges to our efforts to enhance service delivery,” he said. “The cashless revenue collection system will seal the leaks. We will set high targets for revenue collection and it is up to our officers to make sure that we achieve these targets.” ALSO READ:
