They also decried the loss of their dairy cows, which they say died of unknown diseases. Abraham Litare said he had lost one of his three cows to a mysterious disease and wants to be compensated by the authorities. “Our animals are congested in one place, leading to spread of diseases. We also lack pastures to graze our animals because we were evicted by bandits,” he said. He said some residents left their animals in farms since they were unable to drive them to safer places. “This region is a highland and most of us plant various crops like onions, vegetables, pyrethrum and Irish potatoes. The crops are now rotting in farms and we have nothing to eat,” he said. Elizabeth Joseph, a resident, wants the national and county governments to send medical help to the area. The nearest dispensary in Kamelei has been turned into a police camp. “We are suffering and we need the government to help us,” she said. West Pokot Deputy Governor Nicholas Atudonyang toured the region on Thursday and  asked the national government and non-governmental organisations to bolster the county administration’s efforts to provide residents with drugs and clean water.
