A Tory minister shocked the House of Lords by dramatically resigning from Theresa May’s top team in the middle of a debate, apparently because he turned up late. International Development minister Lord Bates, 56, was absent for the beginning of a debate on income inequality, forcing Lords Chief Whip Lord Taylor to step in to answer the opening question from Baroness Lister.

Later in the session, he apologised for his tardiness, saying he was “ashamed” to have been absent. And he said he would be resigning with immediate effect. He said: “My Lord, with the leave of the House, I wonder if you would permit me to offer my sincere apologies to Baroness Lister for my discourtesy in not being in my place to answer her question on a very important matter at the beginning of Questions. “During the five years it’s been my privilege to answer Questions from this despatch box on behalf of the government, I’ve always believed that we should rise to the highest possible standards of courtesy and respect in responding on behalf of the government to legitimate questions of the legislature. “I’m thoroughly ashamed at not being in my place and therefore I will be offering my resignation to the Prime Minister with immediate effect.” As peers shouted “No”, the International Development minister turned and walked out of the chamber. It’s not the first time Lord Bates has resigned from a government job. ALSO READ:
