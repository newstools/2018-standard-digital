Court lifts order suspending Ndii, Wanjigi’s passports The officers said they had orders to serve him with court summons as he is required to appear before a Nyeri Court tomorrow. Wanjigi however, defied orders to leave his vehicle forcing the officers to stick the summon letter on his vehicle’s wind shield. “…whereas your attendance is necessary to appear in the Chief Magistrate’s court in Nyeri to take plea in criminal case No. 251 of 2018…,” it read in part. Standard Digital has not ascertained the authenticity of the letter issued on the application of the prosecution as it was not stamped. Recently in early February 2018, Wanjigi and others linked to the opposition coalition NASA sought anticipatory bail not to be arrested over their roles in the now-controversial swearing-in of Raila Odinga in January 30. However, police said they were not being targeted. Later in February 20, he would be barred alongside Siaya Senator James Orengo from travelling to Zimbabwe for the funeral of the country’s long-time opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai. This was even after High Court had suspended the orders revoking their passports. ALSO READ:
