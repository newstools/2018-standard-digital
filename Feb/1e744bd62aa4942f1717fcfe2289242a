It also confisticated Kenyan cattle that were being grazed there. It was reported that the destruction of the consignment came in the wake of illegal imports and fear of the spread of bird flu. Dar authorities said last year’s destruction of the birds was in line with the country’s Animal Disease Act, 2003.
