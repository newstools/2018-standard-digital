Conte handed ‘present from Mourinho’ in press conference A day after Mr Mudavadi banned party meetings unless they are sanctioned by the secretariat, the party’s National Executive Committee (NEC) and the Parliamentary Group convened to discuss the conduct of the ‘rebels’. Mudavadi took the action in a bid to forestall divisions in the party occasioned by the debate over his failure to attend the swearing-in of NASA leader Raila Odinga on January 30. Speaking after ANC Parliamentary Group and NEC meeting yesterday, the party said Malala and Osotsi were being used to wreck the party with intention of jeopardising Mudavadi's 2022 presidential ambition. ANC PG chair Ayub Savula, Mudavadi’s close ally Sakwa Bunyasi (Nambale), Tindi Mwale (Butere), Christopher Aseka (Khwisero), Ernest Ogesi (Vihiga) and party Secretary General Barrack Muluka declared they would not sit and watch as the two rebels tore the party apart. “We have solid evidence about the sponsorship of these efforts to tear our party apart and nip in the bud Mudavadi's presidential ambition for 2022,” said Savula.
