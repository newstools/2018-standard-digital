Muriithi's poll victory upheld by High Court There was song and dance outside the court as Ng’eno's supporters celebrated the ruling favouring the vocal lawmaker. The court ordered the petitioner, David Keter, to pay Sh3 million, which will be shared equally between Ng’eno, the returning officer and IEBC. Fresh election Justice Justus Bwonong’a of the High Court in Narok said Mr Keter wanted the court to declare Ng’eno invalidly elected, the parliamentary election at the constituency declared null and void, a fresh election to be conducted and the costs of the case to be incurred by the respondents. The petitioner had accused Ng’eno of violence and voter intimidation during the election but his key witnesses were found to have lied, with some issuing contradictory statements. Keter, who garnered 13,707 votes against Ng’eno's 16,098, also enjoined Constituency Returning Officer Lilian Okoth and IEBC in the case. Keter had claimed that the election was interfered with in three wards - Mogondo, Ololmasani and Ilkerin. ALSO READ:
