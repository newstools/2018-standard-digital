Three killed while harvesting sand in Makueni When he did not return on Friday night as was the norm, his relatives from Kitui County launched a search for him. They found his belongings at the shore of the river, raising an alarm to the locals to join in the search for the missing man. The area assistant chief Mr. John Ndetei told of how locals found the killer crocodile basking on a nearby rock and attacked it, slicing its belly open to see if it had eaten the man. “The locals killed the crocodile that was lying on the river bank and they went ahead to disect it and found a human hand in its stomach,” said Ndetei The agitated residents would further drain a section of the river and find the other body parts. Area Member of Parliament Daniel Maanzo has called on the Kenya Wildlife Service to remove crocodiles from the river since they had no benefit to them.
