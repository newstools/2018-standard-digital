The report says the registrar is optimistic the presentation would be helpful in the determination of the election petition. The report reveals that Owino got more votes after the recount. Parties in the case are expected to file and make their oral submissions tomorrow before a verdict is delivered on Friday. The court had ordered for a scrutiny and recount of votes cast in Embakasi East constituency on August 8 last year. Justice Joseph Sergon made the order following a petition filed by Mr Mureithi challenging the election victory of Owino. Justice Sergon said he was satisfied that Mureithi had given sufficient grounds to warrant a recount. ALSO READ:
