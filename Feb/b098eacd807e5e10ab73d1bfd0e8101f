Government ignores court order to lift TV shutdown Central Organisation of Trade Unions Secretary General Francis Atwoli said Jubilee had embraced dictatorship. He questioned why the government had defied a court order suspending the Communication Authority (CA) of Kenya decision to get the three channels off air. “Denying the people their freedom to access information and the media the freedom to disseminate information is dictatorship because these are vital rights,” said Atwoli. Bungoma Senator Moses Wetangula asked Kenyatta to learn from retired President Daniel Moi and his successor Mwai Kibaki, who respected basic human rights and never muzzled the media. “KTN was opened during the birth of multiparty politics and was never shut down by Mzee Moi the Kanu leader, Kibaki stood up and chased mercenaries after they attacked The Standard Group which is what Jubilee needs to learn from,” he said. Kiminini MP Chris Wamalwa said the move by Communications Authority is an abuse of the law.
