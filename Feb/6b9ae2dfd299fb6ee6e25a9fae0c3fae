The petition was filed by former Kasipul MP Oyugi Magwanga, who had cited irregularities in the August 8 elections for the governor’s seat. Awiti garnered 210,173 votes against Magwanga’s 189,060. Magwanga was running as an independent after failing to clinch the ODM nomination in a bruising battle that split the county into roughly two equally strong support bases. Tom Onyango of Jubilee was third with 1,432 votes.  Another independent Medo Misama managed  668 votes. In his victory speech said he would serve the people of Homa Bay diligently. Magwanga, however, rejected the results claiming that they had been manipulated at the tallying tables.
