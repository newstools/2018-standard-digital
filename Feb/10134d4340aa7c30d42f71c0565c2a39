The Judge said that during the general election ,Tongi garnered 14, 410 votes, Jhanda got 11,710 votes, Bichage got 10,445 votes and Kenani got 5,974 votes with none of the 10 witnesses who appeared in court to give their evidence providing enough evidence to prove allegations made by the three petitioners. Justice Ndung’u said that the allegations that voters were turned away from some polling stations, that some agents for the petitioners were chased from some polling stations and that some Presiding officers adjusted votes in favour of the MP were not proven before the Court. “There is no iota of evidence to prove that more voters than those registered voted in the Nyaribari Chache Constituency as claimed by the petitioners, bearing in mind that their agents signed Forms 35A to certify that the election was done as per the constitution,” said Justice Ndung’u. Justice Ndung’u said that an election is a human endeavor which is bound to have some errors, given that it is carried out during the day and counting of votes done at night, sometimes under inhuman conditions and that most errors happened due to fatigue occasioned by the long working hours for the officials. The Judge noted that there was no sufficient evidence of voters’ bribery, presented before the court and that there was no evidence that the MP intimidated the Constituency Returning Officer or any other electoral officials as alleged by the three petitioners.
