The team led by the EALA Northern Corridor Chairman Kasamba Mathias called for action before it is too late. ''It’s of interests to us to trace and see what projects are going on, have been finished and even explore new joint projects that we can do together as we move toward the much hyped East African Federation,’’ he said. Kisumu governor Prof Anyang' Nyong'o who kicked off the debate told the legislators that they must make it a top priority to legislate laws to revive active use of the Lake and its resources sustainably. Despite billions of shillings that had been sunk into the management and conservation of the Lake, it is sad that the fresh water Lake is facing extinction before it impacts on livelihoods positively. The MPs were also concerned that Livelihoods stand at the brink of collapse as no alternative income exists for most fishermen.
