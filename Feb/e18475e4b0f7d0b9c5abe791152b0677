Uhuru's party accuses Maraga of favouring NASA Governor Muthomi Njuki, who was accompanied by his deputy, Nyamu Kagwima, and Chuka/Igambang'ombe MP Patrick Munene, said the former vice president was 'uneasy' in the National Super Alliance (NASA) and was pondering his next move. Mr Munene claimed the life of the NASA coalition ended after its principal, Raila Odinga, took an illegal oath. “Raila went on to swear himself in as the people’s president and within no time, he started calling for elections in August. This shows that he has run out of political ideas and Mr Kalonzo should abandon him,” said the MP. The governor criticised Opposition legislators who were boycotting some sittings in Parliament while continuing to earn salary. "NASA MPs and senators should know that they were elected to represent their people in their respective Houses and that is what they are paid for," he said.
