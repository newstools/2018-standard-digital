Onderi said that the Schools were found to be having unqualified teachers, not having clear students data bank and clear school registers besides using substandard learning materials. “We are advising parents to liaise with the respective Sub County Directors of Education and the Kenya National Examination Council in order to know the destiny of their Children who are set to seat for KCSE,” said Dr Onderi. The County Education Board Chairman confirmed that the two schools were registered earlier to offer Secondary Education but were later found out not meeting the set expectations prompting the quick action.
