County Assembly Speaker David Kombo is fighting possible impeachment after MCAs accused him of corruption and poor management. At least 42 MCAs want Mr Kombo out for allegedly presiding over irregular recruitment of workers when he was the County Public Service Board chairman. ALSO READ:

Witchcraft case against MCA postponed “Forty-two Members of the County Assembly present here today have lost confidence in the leadership of David Kombo as the Kisii County Assembly Speaker. We have decided to impeach him because we do not believe he is going to perform his duties as expected over the next five years,” said Sensi ward's Paul Angwenyi yesterday. Kombo was also accused of nepotism. The MCAs said they were not happy that Kombo employed several relatives during his tenure as board chairman, including his son, who was hired as legal adviser. They claimed he had done the same thing during his time as speaker. Nominated MCA Karen Magara said for the last four months, they had not received any financial reports from the County Assembly Public Service Board. She called on the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission to investigate the board's conduct. But Kombo says he is the victim of a political witch-hunt. “I did not influence my son's employment. I found my son here when I came,” he said.
