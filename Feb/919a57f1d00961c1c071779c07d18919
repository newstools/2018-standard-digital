Miguna: They must all pay for this Miguna was arrested on February 2 from his Runda home by a team of more than 30 heavily armed police officers. Upon arrest, he says, “they took me to all manner of locations. They took me to at least six police stations.” Miguna said police officers accused him of being in Kenya illegally, claiming he was not a Kenyan and deported him. "I will challenge all the illegal and unconditional actions by the despots in court starting today. I have instructed a battery of competent advocates to ensure that the ongoing rogue purveyors of impunity are brought to book."
