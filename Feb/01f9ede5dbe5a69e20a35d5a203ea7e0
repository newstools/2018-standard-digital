Nairobiâ€™s prime residential market is expected to recover within the first half of 2018 as the wave of political uncertainty dissipates, ending a period of price correction experienced in 2016 and 2017, according to a Knight Frank Kenya report. Among factors making Kenya an ideal investment destination include a projected 5.8 per cent GDP growth rate in 2018, rapid urbanisation at 4.3 per cent per annum versus a global average of 2 per cent, an expanding middle class, and positive demographics such as high population growth at 2.6 per cent annually.
