We are in the process of interrogating him. We want him to tell us the exact circumstances which led to the young woman being thrown out of the vehicle so that we can take appropriate action on completion of the investigation,” said Sanya. The Deputy OCPD said an eyewitness to the incident led to the arrest of the driver and the confiscation of the vehicle which had been abandoned away from the accident scene. Sanya, added that preliminary investigations indicate that hours before the incident occurred, the deceased in the company of the driver and two other men had been spotted drinking at a bar in Kericho town. “We are pursuing two lines of investigations; whether the deceased was thrown out of the vehicle because of alcohol intoxication or whether it is an issue of love gone sour. We believe we are going to establish the truth easily since we have the driver of the Probox vehicle in custody,” he said. The deceased's body was removed to Kericho County Hospital mortuary
