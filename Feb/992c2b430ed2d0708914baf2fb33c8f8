Mr Zuma, 75, has resisted calls to quit over corruption allegations. He was replaced as party leader by his deputy, Cyril Ramaphosa, 65, in December. He is now the front runner to succeed him as president. Earlier on Tuesday, the Nelson Mandela Foundation urged Mr Zuma to step down. South Africa had seen "systematic looting" under Mr Zuma's rule, and he "must go sooner rather than later", the foundation said in a statement. In a statement, Ms Mbete said recent "calls for disruption" of a parliament meeting on Thursday "caused us great concern". Therefore the decision had been taken, she said, to "create room for establishing a much more conducive political atmosphere in parliament". She said that "with this in mind", Mr Zuma was approached about postponing the address, but "when we met the president, we then learnt that he was already writing to parliament to ask for the postponement".
