Dr Wanjala told the Standard that blood samples taken from the affected persons show that the victims are suffering from cholera. “We have so far confirmed four deaths and 21 other people are undergoing treatment and we hope to contain the condition,” Dr Wanjala told the Standard. A victim, Martin Wasikoto who the Standard managed to speak to at Kitale referral hospital said he started to develop stomach upsets and diarrhoea after drinking water at a hotel at the slum. “I started experiencing severe diarrhoea on arrival at home before my wife made arrangement to rush me to the hospital but I’m feeling better after the treatment I’m receiving,” said Masikoto who was admitted at the hospital on Saturday. Masikoto is among seven people admitted at ward six male wing while others are admitted at the female wing. The Standard was denied permission to speak to the cholera victims. A team of health workers have pitched tents at Kispongo slum to conduct surveillance and educate dwellers on health issues. “There is a team that has been stationed at Kipsongo to help sensitize the residents on hygienic issues in bid to contain the disease,” a health worker told the Standard.
