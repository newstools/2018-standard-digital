Who hurled bomb and shot at Kalonzo home? The leaders said the function was unconstitutional and that Kenyans should not take it seriously. “The function was the sickest joke of the year. It will not add any value to the people. This country should focus on issues that matter most and that is development,” said Mr Kogo. Turkana South MP lauded President Uhuru Kenyatta and the police for ‘being wise’ by allowing NASA’s function to go on uninterrupted. “It was wise that they allowed them to go on with what they had planned. The function was all drama and we are glad it's over,” said Mr Lomenen. Nakuleu said the former premier was setting a bad example for future leaders. “Raila has set a bad precedent. In future those who will lose in different political positions will follow his steps and ask to be sworn in,” said the Turkana North MP. The leaders also read mischief after Kalonzo Musyoka (Wiper), Moses Wetang'ula (Ford Kenya), and Musalia Mudavadi(ANC) skipped the event. “Kalonzo and team saw that the swearing-in was a joke and that is why they skipped the event. They are lawyers who understand the Constitution,” said Lomenen. ALSO READ:
