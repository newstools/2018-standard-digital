Residents complain that the construction of a bridge on the River had partially blocked it hence the floods. The Kenya National Highways Authority (KENHA) on Thursday issued an alert warning motorists and pedestrians to exercise caution and not attempt to cross the bridge. “Our engineers are on standby to monitor any eventualities that may occur as a result of the overtopping, motorists and pedestrians should consider Kangundo road” said Charles Njogu, Assistant Director Corporate Communication, KENHA. Nairobi and its environs experienced heavy downpour on Thursday disrupting activities. Kipande road, Limuru road, Kenyatta Avenue, Brookside drive, Mombasa road, and Racecourse road near Nairobi River, Ngong road, Globe round-about, Uhuru Highway, Ralph Bunche road and even sections of Thika road were not spared by the rains as floods took over.
