NASA principals’ headache ahead of 2022 succession Addressing Senate Speaker Kenneth Lusaka acknowledged receipt of the letter from Senator Kilonzo and found that Sen Wetangula had been validly removed from the office of The Senate Minority Leader. The Speaker, however, noted that the ODM Parliamentary Group, an organ of the NASA Coalition, was an unknown entity to the Senate and that the requirements of Standing Order 20(5) had not been met accordingly. So, according to the Speaker, "the removal of Moses Wetang'ula as senate Minority leader, though valid, stands suspended and will not take effect." Lusaka concluded that the NASA coalition had to elect a senator in the  in the manner provided  by Standing order 20(1) and provide minutes proving that this decision has been made in writing to his office by the Senate Minority Whip. Meanwhile, on the floor of the house, Senate Majority Leader Kipchumba Murkomen (Elgeyo- Marakwet) asked Wetangu’la to defect to Jubilee where his debating skills would be appreciated. “He can cross the floor as early as Tuesday next week, I will create a seat for him somewhere here.” Murkomen told Wetangu’la that there was no need to force himself on people who did not love him.
