NAIROBI, KENYA: Over half of Kenyan workers are in danger of being rendered jobless as technology replaces manpower, employers have warned. Federation of Kenya Employers (FKE) Executive Director Jacqueline Mugo said on Monday a survey done by the lobby last year showed most companies in the country were automating their work processes to improve efficiency.

She spoke at the launch of the BusinessAfrica Enterprise Forum in Nairobi. The forum was also attended by representatives from the International Organisation of Employers and the French Employers’ Federation. Technological changes have rattled the service industry, particularly the banking sector, with banks replacing tellers with mobile banking. Family Bank is the latest lender to send 150 employees home, putting the figure of bankers out of work last year alone at 2,083, as lenders grappled with dwindling interest income.
