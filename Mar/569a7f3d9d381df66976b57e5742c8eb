In January this year, the owners of Nanyuki Mall crudely kicked out the retailer, physically taking up their goods and throwing them into the streets. The owners claimed that Nakumatt was in rent arrears totaling Sh36 million and it was high time the retailer was shown the door given that its weak liquidity position could not guarantee payments. The owners also claimed that some other retailer was eyeing the space and promising to pay more. Nakumatt has also been kicked out of its core spots in Garden City, Thika Road and Junction malls, and Hazina Towers branch - Nakumatt Lifestyle in Nairobi, as well as other regional outlets in Uganda and Tanzania.
