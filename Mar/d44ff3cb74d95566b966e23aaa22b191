The county's revenue collection has dropped from Sh500 million in 2015 to below Sh100 million this year, according to the deputy governor. Peter Ndambiri said traders failed to pay licence fees after colluding with some county employees. He however said the county government had identified the loopholes used to steal millions of shillings in revenue. “We have now embarked on sealing these loopholes with a warning that any of our employees found engaging in corruption will be sacked and taken to court,” Mr Ndambiri warned as he disbursed Sh2.7 million in bursaries in Kerugoya town yesterday. "The county should be collecting close to a billion in a year," he said.
