Revealed: What transpired during wrong KNH surgery Appearing before the Senate Health Committee yesterday, CS Kariuki said she announced the agreement reached by the board to send the CEO on leave. “I attended a crisis meeting at KNH presided over by board members. They decided to undertake a probe into the matter and found it necessary to send the CEO on compulsory leave to facilitate impartial investigations,” she said. Impartial investigations Committee chairman Michael Mbito (Trans Nzoia) had asked Ms Kariuki to explain her role in sending Ms Koros and the KNH director of clinical services, Benard Githae, packing. The CS said the board acted within the hospital’s human resource rules, which said an employee whose docket was under probe should be asked to take compulsory leave. “The board had to act to restore the confidence of the public in the hospital. The decision was a collective one," noted the CS. May be reinstated A board member chairing the committee investigating Koros and Dr Githae, Mr Daniel Githegi, told the senators that the duo might be reinstated if found innocent. ALSO READ:
