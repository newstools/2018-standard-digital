It will soon be illegal to put up private clinics, laboratories and pharmacies near any public health facilities in Kiambu County. Governor Ferdinand Waititu yesterday announced that his administration was crafting a new law stipulating that private health facilities could only be put up at least 500m away from public facilities.

Public hospitals face crisis as doctors quit Mr Waititu said the law was meant to protect patients from exploitation by private clinics and hospitals located just outside public health facilities. The governor said the proposals stemmed from complaints that patients were being referred to specific private clinics and laboratories near Kiambu, Thika and Gatundu Level Five hospitals. He claimed some private health facilities next to the three public hospitals were colluding with some doctors and hospital staff to get business. “We are aware that some of the people with private hospitals and clinics collude with our staff in the county hospitals in order to cause the machines and equipment to break down so they can get customers in return,” said Waititu. The governor said his administration would introduce a new permit for private hospitals, clinics, laboratories and pharmacies. “We need to know who those seeking to set up private hospitals and laboratories in the county are," he said.
