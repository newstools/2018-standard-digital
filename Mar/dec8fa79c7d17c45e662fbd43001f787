Energy Cabinet Secretary Charles Keter said the water in the dam was at the lowest level and that the situation could worsen if it did not rain in the region. ALSO READ:

However, Mr Keter assured Kenyans that there was no cause for alarm as other dams were operating at full capacity. "Unlike in the previous months of December, January, and February, where we imported power from Uganda, this time we have enough to last us until the dam's level rises. "Sondu Miriu and Turkwel dams are working well and will continue to supply the western parts of the country with power," he said. The CS said the Kenyan Government and Japan had signed an agreement for the construction of a 140mw geothermal power plant at Olkaria V in Naivasha. "This will be a two-year project implemented through the support of the Japan International Cooperation Agency." Keter was speaking when he and other ministry officials met the Senate committee on energy that is on a retreat at Enashipai Resort in Naivasha. Petroleum CS John Munyes said the Government had set up a special unit to investigate cases of adulterated fuel products finding their way into the market. ALSO READ:
