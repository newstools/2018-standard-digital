Germany-based Lufthansa's plane had been traveling from Guarulhos airport in Sao Paulo and was making a stop at Viracopos -- Brazil's biggest freight terminal -- with Zurich as its final destination. The stolen money had been held under the auspices of secure transport provider Brinks, according to the Folha de Sao Paulo newspaper. The daily said five men had threatened security agents on the runway before taking off with the cargo, in barely six minutes. There was no immediate sign of injuries, the airport said. Cargo theft is on the rise in Brazil, where most targets are semi-trucks, especially those serving Rio de Janeiro.
