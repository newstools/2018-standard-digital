State agency declares water rationing A blame game has erupted after the incident was reported at Naivasha Police Station by local leaders. The officer in charge of Kenya Forest Service and the sub-county environmental officer both claimed that they were not aware of the incident. Leaders in the area condemned the incident. Lakeview MCA Karanja Mburu, who was among the first on the scene, accused Government officials in the region of laxity. “None of the Government officers, including the area chief, is aware of this incident,” he said. The MCA said the cutting down of the trees was a mockery to the directive by Deputy President William Ruto, banning logging across the country. “The person who authorised the cutting of these trees claims that he owns the land, this is a lie as the land in question belongs to Nakuru county government,” he said More leaders called for disciplinary action against culprits.
