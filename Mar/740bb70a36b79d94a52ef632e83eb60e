Police on the ground said heavy rains and impatient drivers complicated the situation. The situation was worsened by heavy rains experienced in the city and a presidential motorcade that was leaving a funeral in Machakos area. The motorcade overlapped with several other motorists in their pursuit to beat the traffic jam. Some motorists say they had ran out of fuel and are asking for help to open the gridlock. Some took to social media to vent their anger and frustrations. Others had their friends and relatives tell the experiences they went through on the affected stretch. In the city, most roads are flooded following heavy rainfall experienced yesterday and overnight. There is poor drainage in the city, which has been clogged because of lack of service. ALSO READ:
