The Faridah Karoney-led ministry has been reeling in wanton fraud as perpetrators take advantage of weak systems and unsecured land registries. Individuals transacting on land have had to physically visit a land office, with each stage requiring paperwork. A recent audit report by Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission (EACC) revealed that workers who had no contractual obligation with the Government were handling vital land records. The ministry will begin the process of going paperless to contain this fraud in Nairobi before moving to other Registries across the country. However, other services such as transfer of land ownership, registration of land documents, all payments among others through e-citizen portal will not be affected. ALSO READ:
