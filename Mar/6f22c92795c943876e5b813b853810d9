The ministry had demanded that the journal, Blood Disorders & Transfusion, should withdraw the report, which did not happen. A new report, by among others the Regional Blood Transfusion Centre in Kisumu and US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, shows worrying levels of contamination of donated blood in western Kenya. The report, involving Maseno University and the Jaramogi Oginga Odinga Teaching and Referral Hospital, shows 9.4 per cent of donated blood to be contaminated with HIV, hepatitis and syphilis. The report was published in the journal, BMC Research Notes, on March 12. Improve safety The study says despite efforts to improve safety, a substantial per cent of donated blood in Kenya has infections that can be transmitted to blood recipients. In the Medium Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF) for 2018-2021, the ministry says are meant to improve KNBTS capacity to provide safe blood in three years. The MTEF report published last November shows the money will procure modern blood collection, storage and processing technologies. In Kenya, transfusion involves whole blood as opposed to international best practice where patients are given only the required blood component. ALSO READ:
