At Mamboleo market, the officials aborted the exercise after residents started hurling stones at their convoy after they nabbed four suspects. Other women at the market took to their heels leaving behind their groceries with a number of residents claiming that they were being targeted unfairly. Antony Saisi, the Nema Country director who led the operation said that several people were still using the banned plastic bags and warned that they will bring all of them to book. The official noted that a number of traders and hawkers were still using plastic bags to package their goods in the lakeside town. "We have arrested about 12 people today and we are continuing with the exercise to ensure that everybody complies," said Saisi. He noted that there is need for government agencies to work together to block smuggling of the plastic bags to Kisumu. ALSO READ:
