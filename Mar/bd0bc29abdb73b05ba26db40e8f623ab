Trans Nzoia County Police Commander Samson ole Kine said they are investigating the incident. “A team is on the ground because we are informed the gunmen had an AK47 rifle. The same gang has been linked to a number of attacks in the area,” said Kine. Brig. Yator’s wife, Esther Nandutu, said when her husband identified himself as a security officer he was shot at close range killing him. She said after her husband was shot the gang dragged him in front of their vehicle's headlights as if they were confirming something before ordering her to come out and lie on top of him as they escaped.
