Residents in flood-prone Kuvasali Hills and its environs have been asked to move immediately. Speaking at the weekend, County Meteorological Services Director Vincent Sakwa said heavy rains expected in Western region through to June could cause mudslides at Kuvasali. "The rains expected in one month could be more intense and may cause destruction. We urge people to be on the lookout and move from areas that could be susceptible to floods," he said. Last year, scores of residents were buried alive after a mudslide in the area.
