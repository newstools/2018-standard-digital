In an advert, Lands Principal Secretary Nicholas Muraguri noted that digitisation aims at reducing the turn-around time for their services. A recent audit report by the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission revealed that workers, who had no contractual obligation with the Government, were handling vital land records. Paperless transactions are expected to contain this and other forms of fraud. However, other services such as transfer of land ownership, registration of land documents, and all payments through e-citizen portal will not be affected. In May 2014, the then Lands Cabinet Secretary Charity Ngilu (now Kitui governor) announced a 10-day shutdown of Nairobi and Central registries to undertake audits.
