He added that Criminal Investigation Division had launched investigations to what could have sparked off the fire at the hostel. “Experts from Kenya Power and the Ministry of Public Works among others also on the site to determine what could have caused the fire and from there we will chat the way forward,” said Mbuba. Nonetheless, UoK’s Deputy Vice-chancellor in charge of planning, research and Development Prof Marion Mutugi ruled out foul play. “The fire incident was just an accident. It was contained and there were no casualties. We thank God that the university programs are continuing as scheduled,” she said. ALSO READ:
