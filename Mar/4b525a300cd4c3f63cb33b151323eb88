If granted a licence, the Tanzanian miller will join seven other private sugar millers, including Kwale International Sugar Company Ltd (Kiscol), which is located in the coastal belt. Kiscol was built between 2007 and 2015 at an estimated cost of $200 million (Sh20 billion). Private millers Other private millers include West Kenya Sugar, Kibos Sugar, Butali Sugar, Transmara Sugar, Sukari Industries and Kisii Sugar Factory. Five State-owned millers — Chemelil, Muhoroni, Miwani, Nzoia and Sony  — have been struggling amid plans by the Government to privatise them. The only other listed Government-owned miller, Mumias Sugar Company, is also struggling despite several interventions and is now seeking a Sh4 billion bail-out to revive its milling plant and promote efficiency.
