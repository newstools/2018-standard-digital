People are now living in fear because we do not know when the next attack will happen,” said Joseph Kiprop, a resident.

The shaking is extreme and causes destruction,” he said. Another local, Agnes Cheptebkei said the tremors last for more than 30 seconds and that some residents have suffered injuries. “Many people get scared when the tremors occur. Others are injured as they run, fearing for their lives,” she said. One building was partially destroyed during the attack that happened on Friday and property of unknown value destroyed. “We are worried there might be an earthquake waiting to happen.
