The tariffs were gazetted by County Secretary Patrick Mukuria and were a relief to consumers after a three-year wait. The county government has also ordered that deposit for customers be reduced from Sh2,500 to Sh1,000. Mr Mukuria said the tariffs would be effected by all the area's five water companies, as ordered by Governor Mwangi wa Iria, to ensure the public in all the eight sub-counties got connected to piped water. Five companies “All the five companies have no excuse but to bill the clients as per the approved tariffs,” said Mukuria. Iria, upon his re-election, declared he would concentrate his energies on providing water to the more than 840,000 people in the lower areas at affordable rates. Last week, Muwasco suffered a blow after the Water Services Regulatory Board ordered it to stop distributing water in Maragua town. The regulator declared that the Maragua area was the jurisdiction of the Murang’a South Water and Sanitation Company (Muswaco). ALSO READ:
