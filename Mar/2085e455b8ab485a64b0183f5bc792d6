It’s an ideal location for any cooperate headquarters with its own dedicated entrance and access to over 100 shops and restaurants at the mall alongside our Garden City apartments and townhouses,” said Coulson on Tuesday. Koome Gikunda, Director Actis, the developer said: “The mall, which welcomes 400,000 shoppers a month is growing from strength to strength, with IMAX and Shoprite’s Choppies due to open as anchor tenant after the exit of Nakumatt Supermarket.With the breaking ground for the first phase of the business park, it will be the next big step in completing our vision of live, work and play concept.” Coulson said the parking ratio for the office spaces, which will be six-floor buildings, will be four cars for every 1,000 square feet. The contractor for the business spark is Mentor Management Turner and Townsend. Knight Frank will be the managers of the property. Avoid fake news!
