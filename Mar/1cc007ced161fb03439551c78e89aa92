A group of Orange Democratic Movement (ODM) party leaders on Sunday declared that National Super Alliance (NASA) leader Raila Odinga would not hand over the mantle to his co-principals to contest the presidency in 2022. Led by ODM Secretary General Edwin Sifuna (pictured) they said Raila would not support Wiper party leader Kalonzo Musyoka, Ford-Kenya leader and Bungoma Senator Moses Wetang'ula or Amani National Congress (ANC) party's Musalia Mudavadi if they vied for the presidency.

Although a memorandum of understanding signed by the four NASA principals and deposited with the Registrar of Political Parties before the August 2017 elections stipulated that ODM would not field a candidate come 2022, the party's new secretary general has rejected the agreement. Speaking at a church service in Mathare, Nairobi, Mr Sifuna said they could not support "cowards", in reference to Raila's controversial January 30 'swearing-in' as the 'people's president' that led to the arrest of some Opposition leaders. "If you were not at Uhuru Park, do not come to us for consideration of any manner. You are simply a coward," said Sifuna. He said they were ready to fight anyone with a different opinion: "We are not afraid of anyone." Nominated MP Godfrey Osotsi (ANC) said he was ready to rally all youths behind Raila. "We are firm because we are confident Raila is the only man to deliver this country from the hands of cartels," he said. Uriri MP Mark Nyamita said for the longest time, the coalition had invested a lot in preparing the principals for leadership. ALSO READ:
