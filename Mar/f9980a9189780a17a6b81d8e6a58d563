Ugandaâ€™s President Yoweri Museveni has sacked his security minister and chief of police, he said via Twitter late on Sunday, but gave no reason for the firings although media has reported a feud between the two outgoing officials. Museveni, who has been in power for 32 years, frequently replaces ministers and other top government officials without publicly giving explanations. ALSO READ:

He also named Okoth Ochola as the new chief of police, replacing Kale Kayihura. Media has reported on a simmering feud between the two sacked officials who fought alongside Museveni in a five-year guerrilla war that brought him to power in 1986. Kayihura was a target of widespread public anger for failing to stem a wave of crime. He has also attracted significant public censure for a police crackdown on opposition activists, often breaking up rallies with teargas, beatings and detentions.
