That is the discourse we should stick to, especially those of us who are from Jubilee Party,” said Ruto. He was categorical that leaders should not deviate from what they outlined in the Jubilee manifesto on the four development pillars. Earlier, former Industrialisation Minister Henry Kosgei used the platform to advise leaders in the region against losing focus but rather rally behind DP on his 2022 State House bid. “The race to 2022 is not far and our leaders should not lose focus because I am certain that the DP is firm and understands his primary duty. As a community, we do not have any other chance other than supporting him. "I am solidly behind him and it will be prudent if we are given a chance to deal with those who want to go against him,” said Kosgei. Ainabkoi MP Wiliam Chepkut dismissed plans to amend the Constitution to pave way for the creation of prime minister position, saying citizens were not ready for another referendum. Among those in attendance were Uasin Gishu Governor Jackson Mandago, Senator Margaret Kamar, MPs Oscar Sudi (Kapseret), Caleb Kositany (Soy) and Janet Rotich (Turbo). ALSO READ:
