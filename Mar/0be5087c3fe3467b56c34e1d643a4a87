NAIROBI, KENYA: Atul Shah has moved to the Court of Appeal to protest forceful eviction on Friday of Nakumatt at Nyali City Mall. Shah is seeking a review of Justice Charles Yano decree issued in March 5 2018 allowing Ideal Location Limited, the owners of the mall, to evict Nakumatt Supermarket that has rented the premises since June 14 2009.
Justice Yano had found Nakumatt in breach of the sub-lease agreement dated June 14 2009 with Ideal Location Limited and had accrued arrears amounting to a tune of Sh27, 812, 108 as at November 1 2017. ALSO READ:
