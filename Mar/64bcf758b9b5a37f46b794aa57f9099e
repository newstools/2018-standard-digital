NCIC hunt for musicians who released hate song over Kitui charcoal ban Njau had denied the charges before Chief Magistrate Francis Andayi who released him on a cash bail of Sh700,000. Through his lawyers, Kuria had moved to the Milimani Law Courts to request for a review of the cash bail. Kuria said on Monday they would move to the High Court so that Njau can be granted anticipatory bail. According to the prosecution, the suspect sang the song jointly with others. The court heard the 'Ikamba' song contained words calculated to stir ethnic hatred between the Kamba and the Kikuyu communities. Njau was apprehended by the National Cohesion and Integration Commission whose officials said they were looking for the second suspect.
