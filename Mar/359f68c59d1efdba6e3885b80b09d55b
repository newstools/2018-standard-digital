A Court of Appeal hearing yesterday sought to determine whether the Wajir governor has a university degree. Governor Mohamed Abdi was fighting to for reinstatement after the High Court nullified his August 8, 2017 election. His lawyers, Fred Ngatia and Tom Macharia, joined forces with electoral commission lawyers Kamau Karori and Mahat Somane to argue that the High Court disregarded evidence showing Mr Mohamed had been cleared to vie. Mr Ngatia said his client was unjustly crucified over evidence obtained from parliamentary proceedings, which referred to a second degree. He argued that at the time the governor was interviewed for an ambassador’s post in September 2013, he had one degree and was pursuing a master's degree from a Ugandan university. Court of Appeal judges Asike Makhandia, Phillip Waki and Patrick Kiage heard that no one produced any complaints that the transcripts Mohamed produced in the High Court were forged. “There was no forgery element that was proved. He has a degree. His transcripts were tendered and this cannot be controverted,” argued Ngatia. Avoid fake news!
