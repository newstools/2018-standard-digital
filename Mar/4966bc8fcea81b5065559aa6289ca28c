Vocal politicians lose their seats, ordered to pay millions Mr Wambora has faulted Justice William Musyoka who found irregularities during counting and tallying of results. Justice Musyoka said the anomalies during the election were too immense and it would be a travesty of justice to wish them away, or even to ignore them. He ruled the only recourse left was to order a fresh election in 60 days. But in his memorandum of appeal, the governor says the judge erred in misconstruing, misrepresenting, and mis- applying regulation 81 of the election in the context of the scrutiny and recount of votes. Through lawyer Kithenji Marete, Wambora says the judge erred in nullifying the election, thereby subjugating the democratic will of voters. Avoid fake news!
