The Oscar was retrieved and later returned to McDormand. Bryant posted a video of himself in a tuxedo at the event holding an Oscar statuette and telling other guests he was a winner. It was not immediately clear in what capacity he was attending the event, but police said he had a ticket. "After a brief time apart, Frances and her Oscar were happily reunited. They celebrated the reunion with a double cheeseburger from In and Out," McDormand's representative, Simon Halls, said in a statement, referring to a local fast-food chain. McDormand, 60, won her second acting Oscar for her role as an angry, grieving mother in "Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri."
