“We want to remove the stain that we are frustrating Kenyans in order to be bribed,” declared President Uhuru Uhuru Kenyatta when he made an impromptu visit at the Lands Registry in 2014. His spoke in glowing terms about then Cabinet Secretary Charity Ngilu and what she was doing to rid the department the enduring tag of corruption and inefficiency, where a file took on average three months to be processed.

Land registries closed to allow digital switch Mrs Ngilu was treading where even angels feared to tread. It is no secret that the Ministry of Lands exemplifies the slow-moving, labyrinthine nature of public service. No effort is spared to make the process ever cumbersome and tedious. And corruption feeds off this style of doing things. To move a file; to get the relevant stamp and signature on it, one must grease a palm. The premium of the bribe is raised by hiding away the file. Land is a factor of production and matters to do with ownership and transfer will naturally attract much interest. So closing the Registry once again for 10 days, starting to transition the analog registry to digital is commendable.  A digitised land registry will considerably limit the room for the cartels to engage in mischief. Of course, there are those who will wonder: isn’t the same people who will operate the technology put in place? After all, isn’t a system as good as those who operate it? Nonetheless, digitising the records is one way no less significant that will help straighten things at the Lands Registry and save landowners the agony of missing files and a long wait. Lost records will be retrieved at the touch of a button. And what’s more, a digital format leaves a trail of finger prints for easy traceability of who did what and when.
