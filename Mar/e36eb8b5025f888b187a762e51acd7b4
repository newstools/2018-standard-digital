Learning in all public universities has been paralysed since March 1 following the industrial action that was called by the university unions. The employees drawn from University Academic Staff Union (UASU), Kenya University Staff Union (KUSU) and Kenya Union of Domestic, Hotels, Educational Institutions, Hospitals and Allied Workers (Kudhiha) had vowed to continue with their strike until the Government responds to issues raised in their 2017-2021 CBA. On March 14, the dons accused the Government of unwillingness to negotiate. George Kegode, chairman of Uasu Moi University Chapter, told the Press that the move by Inter-Public Universities Council Consultative Forum (IPUCCF) to withdraw from the negotiating table would not help end paralysis in the universities.
