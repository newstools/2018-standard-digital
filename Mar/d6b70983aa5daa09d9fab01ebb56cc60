The books cost the Government Sh7.5 billion. “It was a pilot targeting 470 schools and if there are hiccups, they will be addressed.

In an article published in a local daily on Tuesday, KICD Director for Research, Monitoring and Evaluation Cyril Oyugi confirmed that the institute had established that there were multiple errors in some of the books but that mechanisms had been put in place to rectify them. “Teams have been formed to look over the mistakes and they are doing corrections.
