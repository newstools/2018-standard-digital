Man claims in-laws lied about killer wife The boy's body was found dumped at Prayer Centre in Bahati. According to police, the suspect had been living with the boy after he and his wife separated. Bahati OCPD Edward Wafula said the suspect was arrested after residents discovered the child's body on a road a few metres from his house. “We suspect that he killed the boy at his house on Sunday and fled,” Mr Wafula said. The boy's grandmother told the police that she had left the three-year-old with the suspect on Sunday to attend a funeral meeting in the neighborhood. When she went to check on her grandson on Monday morning, neither he nor the suspect were in the house. “On March 12, 2018, at around 6am, she went into their house to check (on) the child, but there was nobody in the house,” read the police statement. “While searching, she got information from a passer-by who had seen the body of a child dumped on the road about 200 metres away, wrapped with blankets,” the police report said.
