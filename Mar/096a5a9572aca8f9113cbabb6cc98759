Kenya has initiated fresh plans to demarcate an international boundary in Lake Victoria shared by Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania to end recurrent territorial conflicts. The government has dispatched a team of international boundary surveyors to check colonial boundaries in the lake. Kenya Head of International Boundaries, Julius Rotich, said they plan to embark on demarcation of the lake boundaries. Kenya and Uganda authorities agreed to resolve the territorial dispute in Lake Victoria and invested Sh140 million to review their boundaries. “There are talks going on between the two governments and we intend to move to the lake and start fresh boundary reviews and erection of earth pillars by next month. The exercise will take 60 days,” he said. Previous efforts to redraw the boundary stalled after the preliminary results showed the disputed Migingo Island was 510 metres inside Kenya as was evidenced by the colonial maps dating back to 1926 order in council. Rotich explained that the surveyors will map the five islands on Lake Victoria Mageta, Sumba, Ringiti, Pyramid and Migingo to resolve the boundary row. Avoid fake news!
