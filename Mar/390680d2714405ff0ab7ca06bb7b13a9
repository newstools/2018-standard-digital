Address mass teachers' failure to halt falling education standards Judge George Odunga ruled that the cancellation was not done in accordance with the law. He has ordered KNEC to carry out proper investigations into allegations of cheating at the school within 14 days so as to determine whether the results were valid or not. In the results released in December 2017 by the former Education CS Fred Matiang’i the school was ranked 16th nationally, second in western and top in Kakamega County. KNEC later cancelled the results three weeks after the release. The school got a mean score of 8.911 with all 190 candidates attaining the minimum university entry. The first student got A- of 79 points while the last one got C+. Judge Odunga has ordered the examination body to pay the school administration and the board all the costs incurred. Avoid fake news!

Parents at the school also condemned the council and the Ministry of Education for incompetence. They accused CS Matiang’i for rushing to release KCSE results before verifying them only to subject students to psychological torture. “Why was the CS in hurry to release the results then cancel them? We will sue the council, Prof Magoha and Matiang’i for subjecting students to psychological torture,” said Donald Sifuna, a parent. ALSO READ:
