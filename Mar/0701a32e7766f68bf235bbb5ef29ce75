Build algorithms And most corporations are not putting money into this area. She said, most universities teach Information Technology (IT) which she insisted should not be confused with data science. She described data science as a mixture of IT, statistics and Mathematics. “You use statistics to build algorithms and you package them as software,” said Kesse. The training in each county will be done in two-and-half days and will involve discussion on how people can scale up their business using data science. The trainees will also be taught how algorithms are built. “This is a pilot project. We begin it in Kenya, we can also go to other countries,” said Kesse. The Economist described data as the new oil.
