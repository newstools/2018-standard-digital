Millions of taxpayers money go to waste as maternity wards fail to deliver Data reviewed by researchers for the leading cause of neonatal deaths at Pumwani Maternity Hospital in 2016, but published this year singled out asphyxia. When this happens, it compromises other cells in the body especially the brain. Such a condition happens during or immediately after birth and can go unnoticed by the specialist. Probable causes, according to the research that made up this year’s Kenya Medical Research Institute eighth annual conference, include poor monitoring of birth progress and lack of quick interventions when complications arise during labour. “Three quarters of deaths occurred in the first three days of life and the leading cause of death was asphyxia,” read the research in part.
