Parliament passed the tax in 2013. Its implementation was, however, given a three-year grace period to September 2016. The government further extended the period by two years, bringing it to September this year. Atwoli wants it scrapped altogether. “The Energy Regulation Commission should stop lying to Kenyans, for the last seven months the price of petrol has been skyrocketing under its watch," said Atwoli. "How can a commission lower petrol price by Sh0.46 in one day and later work with the treasury to add VAT tax of up to Sh17? This unacceptable. The Commission should know that Kenyans are not fools,” he added. ALSO READ:

It will push the cost of doing business higher and force employers to sack workers,” he said.
