Civil society organisations have questioned delayed approval of nine nominees for position of chief officer. Three weeks after MCAs vetted the nominees, it is not clear when successful candidates will take office. Following the delay, officials of Nakuru County Public Opinion Consultative Initiative, Nakuru Human Rights Network and Nakuru Accountability Forum, yesterday claimed MCAs were frustrating the process for political reasons. “We don't want politics to take centre stage in this important process. The Speaker should explain why the Assembly is frustrating this process,” said Nakuru County Public Opinion Consultative Initiative secretary Dan Murungu. Vetting of nominees was concluded on February 27. MCAs retreated the following day to write their reports on their suitability. However, they are yet to table the reports in the House for debate.

A section of MCAs are deliberately frustrating the process for their own selfish gains,” activist Eliseff Magoma said. However, the Leader of the Majority in the Assembly Stanley Karanja dismissed the claims saying the process has no legal timelines. "Members are busy with other businesses of the House," he said. He added: “We will summon the committee chairmen and have them expedite the reports. The civil society should stop reading too much in the delay." Chief Officers are accounting officers and policy implementors of departments. They are technical administrators of county departments.
