Kenya has been left out of a new deal brokered by Tanzania that seeks to lower cross-border charges on trucks ferrying goods across the borders. The deal announced by the Central Corridor Transit Transport Facilitation Agency (CCTTFA) will see Ugandan and Burundian trucks that cross Tanzanian borders charged $152 (Sh15,397) from $500 (Sh50,165) that was charged before.

CCTTFA Executive Secretary Dieudonne Dukundane said during a United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (Unctad) capacity building workshop in Arusha that cross-border charges have been a huge impediment to free flow of trade and need to be harmonised. “The three countries of Tanzania, Uganda and Burundi have agreed to lower these charges,” Mr Dukundane told Tanzanian daily, The Citizen. “We have an agreement to harmonise the cross-border charges and in fact, a transit truck pays only $152, down from $500 to pass through Tanzanian borders,” he added. CCTTFA is tasked with easing cross-border trade especially by improving transport logistics between Tanzania and its neighbours. The agency also runs the Tanzanian Central Transport Corridor, a main competitor for Kenya’s Northern Corridor in attracting transit cargo through each country’s coastal ports. Tanzania President John Magufuli has been on the forefront in promoting the corridor, upgrading the ports of Dar es Salaam and Tanga, while at the same time building a new Standard Gauge Railway that is about to be completed. The Northern Corridor is run under the ministry of East African Community. ALSO READ:
