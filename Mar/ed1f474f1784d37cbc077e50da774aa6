Four people escaped death narrowly in a mid-morning accident after a vehicle they were traveling in lost direction and overturned in a ditch near Sameer, along Mombasa Road. On-lookers watched helplessly as a white Toyota Fielder swerved side to side before rolling into the ditch and resting on the tree trunk beside the road. According to the driver Wycliffe Oigara, who is also the vehicle owner, two boda boda operators approached him to help them rush their sick friend to St Marys hospital, after which the crash happened minutes into the journey. “They approached me with a patient and I offered to help them take him to the hospital. There is no way I would have turned them down, said Oigara. He said that he was moving at 40 Kilometres per hour, and that the he could not understand how he lost the direction within an eye blink. A witness who did want to be named for undisclosed reason corroborated Oigara’s statement. She confirmed having seen a patient being laid in the backseat of a white Toyota car at GM bus stage. Oigara escaped unhurt. The teary boda boda operators were limping while the patient was lying with his ribs still as blood gushed from his forehead. No one could tell whether he was breathing or not. The three were rushed to St Mary’s hospital as the police arrived on the scene to conduct the investigation.
