Kenyan survivor of murderous attack in the US now seeks help Police said the attackers also destroyed a communication mast in the area cutting communication. North Eastern regional commissioner Mohamud Saleh said the attackers targeted Administration and Kenya Police camps in the area. The attackers first trained their guns on a Safaricom mast in Lafey town  to disable communication, before storming the camps. "Locals are reporting seeing five bodies but we are moving there for more,” he said. Locals said a number of officers ran for their lives or are injured after the 1 am attack. Other police officers said the attackers may have planted explosives in the camps. The area has been facing a series of attacks in the past two months that saw many communication masts destroyed. The latest attack happened last month when three teachers were killed in Wajir. This prompted mass transfer of non-local teachers that angered local politicians. ALSO READ:
