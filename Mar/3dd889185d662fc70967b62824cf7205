That is the way we had to receive these resources. Not a single dollar was missing,” said Njoroge. He further explained that on February 28, CBK received Sh200 billion into this account.

One of the things of course is repaying loans they have,” said the governor. Finance Cabinet Secretary Henry Rotich indicated that part of the Eurobond cash would be used to pay Sh100 billion loans that will mature next year. ALSO READ:
