The Kenya Medical Supplies Agency has appealed to counties to pay debts amounting to Sh2.8 billion. Speaking while delivering drugs worth Sh65 million to Nyeri County Thursday, Kemsa Finance Director Waiganjo Karanja said the debts were straining the agency's ability to deliver supplies, even to counties that had paid up.

Tough times for patients as counties fail to pay for drugs Commending the county for paying for all medical supplies, Mr KaranjaÂ said debts owed by devolved units continued pilling because the State agency could not completely cut off supplies. Governor Mutahi Kahiga said the latest supplies were meant for health centres in the county as the level 5 and 4 facilities had already received their consignments. Meanwhile, Nyeri county government will spend Sh270 million to revamp Level 4 hospitals in the area. Governor Kahiga said the Sh270 million would be used in about 10 projects advertised to cater for specific needs of the health facilities for upgrades and equipment supply before the end of the financial year.
