Godec becomes the longest serving US envoy, not just to Kenya but also in the world, having stayed for slightly over six years. Most US ambassadors serve for three years. His tour of tour of duty was extended twice, allowing him to oversee the August 2017 General Election and October 26 repeat presidential election. ALSO READ:

Huge anti-gun rallies sweep US Critics have accused Godec of openly siding with the Government in the face of rising accusations of human rights abuses, corruption, and electoral malpractices. He became the first US ambassador in Kenya to face street protests by opposition supporters, who burnt his effigy and the US flag outside the embassy in Gigiri, accusing him of political bias. Diplomacy pundits say Godec is a sharp contrast to his predecessors Smith Hempstone, William Bellamy, and Michael Ranneberger, who served during presidents Daniel Moi and Mwai Kibakiâ€™s regimes. Rogue ambassador Hempstone, who served as the US envoy to Kenya between 1989 and 1993, earned the tag 'rogue ambassador' for piling pressure on the Moi government to end the single-party rule. He was appointed ambassador to Kenya at a time when the United States was beginning to push African countries toward democracy and respect of human rights. Moi accused Hempstone of aiding dissidents and befriending opponents of the administration, causing the African press to describe Hempstone's style as 'bulldozer diplomacy'. ALSO READ:

Kibaki and Raila publicly chided Ranneberger following claims that the ambassador was organising and bankrolling the youth to take over. Politicians allied to the grand coalition government convened press conferences demanding that then US President Barack Obama recall Ranneberger.
