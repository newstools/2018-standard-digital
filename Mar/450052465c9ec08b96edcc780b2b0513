The motion requires 116 MPs to sail through. But even as the process of the CS’s removal from office gained momentum, Ms Chege pleaded with the legislators to be patient and allow the committee to conclude its inquiry. She said her team would summon Ms Kariuki, professional bodies in the health sector, the management of the referral hospital, including and the suspended chief executive, and the families of the patients. She said the committee would also be ready to meet any Kenyan with information on the incident. “We have opened the inquiry so that Kenyans can hear the truth on the matter. What has been said is only hearsay as no one has come out in the open to explain what happened,” Chege said. But MPs stepped up their push to impeach the Health CS and said they would present their petition to Speaker Justin Muturi next week. ALSO READ:
