Meru University VC Magambo sent home Mr Njoroge is said to have been killed by a plainclothes policeman. The family complained that a week after Njoroge's death, no one had taken responsibility. Peter Gathuri, the victim's father, accused the police of keeping them in the dark regarding investigations. The 24-year-old student was expected to graduate later this year. Mr Gathuri has asked Interior Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang'i to intervene so he can get justice for his son. "The investigating officers have been taking us round in circles. We feel they are just waiting for the burial so they can forget about the investigations," he said. "My son was a disciplined role model for many. We had high hopes for him. His death is a big loss for us thanks to that trigger-happy officer." The Independent Policing Oversight Authority is also investigating the killing. And Nakuru Youth Forum chairman Charles Mburu said: "We shall follow the case to its logical conclusion." ALSO READ:
