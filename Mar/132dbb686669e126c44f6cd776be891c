Farmers have rejected a proposal to privatise the South Nyanza Sugar Company (Sony). Sony is among five sugar millers earmarked for privatisation. Speaking during a meeting convened by the Privatisation Commission yesterday, farmers expressed fears that privatisation of the giant sugar miller would lead to job losses. The farmers also opposed plans to allocate them 24 per cent of the company's shares once privatised. They told the commission that they were ready to take over the entire management of the company if the Government waived its current debts and stopped the importation of cheap sugar. "Allowing cheap sugar into the country is hurting the local millers," Ben Okello, a farmer from Uriri constituency, told the commission. Avoid fake news!

Mr Nyamita faulted the commission for ignoring the concerns of the leaders from sugarcane growing areas during previous meetings. “We had earlier advised the commission to disregard the privatisation proposal and address challenges facing ailing sugar mills,” Nyamita said. He challenged the Sugar Management Board to publish regulations addressing challenges faced by local millers, especially cane poaching. Mr Kitayama added that instead of privatising Sony Sugar, the Government should waive a Sh1 billion debt owed by the firm. Governor Okoth Obado suggested that the Government should hand over the company to the county and farmers. Commission chairman Henry Obwocha said his team would consider all the suggestions.
