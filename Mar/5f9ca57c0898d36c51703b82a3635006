Deputy President William Ruto has said the Jubilee government will distribute resources fairly, including to regions that did not vote for it. He said the Coast gave them fewer votes compared to those of the Opposition, but the government will not discriminate them in resource allocation. ALSO READ:

Joho changes tune, to work with Uhuru “We thank you for the votes you gave us, though few, but we will not consider that in our development agenda,” said Ruto in Kwale County on Saturday. After Kinango MP Benjamin Tayari led other legislators in asking for speedy construction of roads and resettling of squatters, the DP said the Government will act on all issues raised. Ruto said the government plans to issue 10,000 new title deeds to Kwale residents by June. “A few years ago we issued around three million title deeds, 300,000 of which were issued to Coast residents. Of these 40,000 came to Kwale and in the next three months we are going to issue another 10,000 title deeds,” he said. He opened the newly tarmacked Milalani-Mivumoni road. He said within two years they will finish tarmacking other roads, Samburu-Kinango, Lunga Lunga-Vanga, Ramisi Funzi, Kwale-Kinango and Dongo Kundu bypass. All the road projects will cost Sh40 billion, which the Deputy President said is already available. And ODM MPs told their supporters that the party has neither joined Jubilee nor left the National Super Aliance (NASA). Kwale Woman Representative Zuleikha Hassan and Jomvu MP Omar Mwinyi assured the electorate that they were still in the opposition. “I support the show of unity between President Uhuru Kenyatta and our party leader Raila Odinga but we have not bolted out of NASA,” said Hassan.
