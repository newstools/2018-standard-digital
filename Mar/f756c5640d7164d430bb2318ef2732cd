 Police have arrested former Kenya National Union of Nurses (KNUN) Chairman Joh Bii outside the Milimani Law Courts in Nairobi. Bii was arrested mid-morning on Monday for allegedly defrauding the Union millions of cash. We cannot, however, ascertain the exact amount he is accused of swindling the union of but we will be following up as the events unfold. He is said to have diverted membersâ€™ contribution to a personal account. The embattled unionist is not new to controversy. In early 2017, KNUN executive committee led by its Secretary General Seth Panyako had tried to fire John Bii from the union who they termed as an imposter. That decision was however reversed by the Employment and Labour Relations Court Judge, Monica Mbaru, who ruled that it was illegal and contrary to court orders. Mr Bii ceased to be the chairman of the nurses union in December 2016, according to Deputy Secretary General Morris Opetu. The union has been bedeviled by infighting and differences among its officials for a while now. More to follow.
