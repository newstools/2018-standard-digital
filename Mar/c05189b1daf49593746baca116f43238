I owe my appointment to the President, and a thank him for that,” said Mr Noor. Mr Abey said the party entered a pre-election agreement with President Uhuru and his deputy William Ruto and not with Roba. Mr Roba was quoted in media reports claiming role in the appointment of Noor as part of his efforts to reconcile communities in the county following a divisive politics that pitted him against the Council of Elders that was backing EFP candidates. Noor termed the claims as political sideshows by his opponent and asked the governor to brace for a court battle challenging his win for a second term. The former Provincial Commissioner has moved to the Court of Appeal to challenge the High Court ruling that upheld Roba’s victory. “Roba should brace for a political battle because my appeal is still on. We don’t recognise him because he did not win fairly,” added Noor. The party said it was grateful for the appointment but asked the President to consider it for more jobs in the Jubilee administration. ALSO READ:
