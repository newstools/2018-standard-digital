For the second time, I got it wrong. Statistics in Kenya are not collected, compiled and released by IEBC as reported two weeks ago, or the Kenya National Bureau of Standards as reported last week. This is the responsibility of the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics. One of the reports released by the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics in March 2012 was the 2009 Kenya Population and Housing Census Analytical Report on Housing Conditions Amenities and Household Assets.

Why PM post is on everyone’s lips According to this report, in August 2009 Kenya had 15.3 million dwelling units.  These 15.3 million dwelling units had 23.3 million rooms.  The 23.3 million rooms accommodated 38.4 million people. There were 10.6 million dwelling units in rural areas. Urban areas had 4.7 million dwelling units. 26.3 million people lived in rural areas. 12 million people lived in urban areas. There were only 23.3 million rooms available for 38.4 million people. The number of people sharing rooms in urban areas was higher than those sharing in rural areas. There was a shortage and higher demand for housing in urban than in rural areas. Over crowding Seventy seven per cent of families lived in dwelling units constructed out of mud and other types of non-durable materials. Fifty seven per cent of families lived in homes whose floors were constructed from mud. Only 33 per cent of the homes in urban areas were owned by their inhabitants, a low figure compared to 89 per cent ownership in rural areas. In Nairobi, only 13 per cent of households owned the houses that they lived in. The collected housing data indicated that there was overcrowding in major cities. For example, over 280,000 households in Nairobi with one habitable room housed three persons. As of August 2009, 18,000 people were homeless. Of these, over 12,000 lived in urban areas, and 5,000 in rural areas. There are fundamental reasons for undertaking a National Housing Census. The collection of data is not limited to the number of dwelling units, the rooms available, the number of persons housed and the type of materials used in construction. An important aspect of the data collection is household amenities. For example, connection to water, electricity, and a sewage line, and the type of fuels used in cooking. Housing Census data discloses housing conditions in cities, rural areas and in different regions. The data provides a measure of the national housing deficit. It ascertains the number of families living in makeshift or unsuitable housing. It discloses where there is overcrowding. National Housing Census data also aids in planning by government. Part of Jubilee’s Big Four Plan is the construction of 500,000 affordable homes in Kenya across the major towns. NSSF plays a pivotal role in this housing plan. The 2013 NSSF Act will be operationalised so that monthly NSSF contributions are raised from Sh200 to Sh1,080 per person. The Retirement Benefits Authority Act will be amended to allow NSSF to invest 30 per cent of members’ contributions in real estate. ALSO READ:

IEBC opts for guarded servers The pilot phase will be the construction of 8,200 units. These units will be put up in 55 acres in Mavoko belonging to NSSF. Another 150,000 units will be constructed on 1,000 acres belonging to NSSF in Mavoko. The cost of constructing the 8,200 units is estimated at Sh28 billion. The cost of constructing the 150,000 units is estimated at Sh500 billion. NSSF will meet the bill for the pilot phase. Out of 500,000 houses, Machakos County will benefit from at least 30 per cent of the units. The 2009 National Housing Census data lends credence to the plan by government to supplement homes for Kenyans and particularly in urban areas where there is overcrowding. However, this data is outdated. Jubilee’s Big Four Housing Masterplan will benefit more in applying the 2019 Housing Census data to ensure that there is equitable distribution of the housing units across the country. - Kethi D Kilonzo is an advocate of the High Court of Kenya. finclegal@hotmail.com
