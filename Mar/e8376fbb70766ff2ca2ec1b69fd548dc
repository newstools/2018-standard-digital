Isaac Kosgei is the new vice chancellor at Moi University. He replaces Laban Ayiro, who has been at the helm of the second largest university in Kenya for a year. Until his appointment, Prof Kosgei was the deputy vice chancellor in charge of administration and finance at Laikipia University. “This is a big responsibility I have been given by the President and the Ministry of Education. My focus will be on innovation,” Kosgei said at Moi University yesterday. “Our institution is privileged to have Rivatex textiles. It also has schools of health, which are key in achieving (one of) President Uhuru Kenyatta’s four development pillars,” he added. “The most important person is the student and as the VC, I urge team work to achieve our goals as an institution.” Members of the university senate, who were present during the handing-over ceremony, expressed confidence in the new VC.
