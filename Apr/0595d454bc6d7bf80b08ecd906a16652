She noted after checking outside and with neighbours without finding him, he came back to the house and checked in the bedroom. “I found him sleeping while there was a rope in his neck. He was already dead. It is then that I informed other people in the compound,” she said. She said it was a mystery to the family as the boy had not shown any signs of distress and no one had threatened him on anything in the family. Avoid fake news!
