The General Manager Joseph Oduor however ruled out a possible auction of property, saying efforts were being made to settle the award. He said the loss making facility was weathering a storm “but things are under control and we are working on it.” He said the two casual labourers were rendered redundant by falling fortunes that forced it to cut costs through layoffs.
