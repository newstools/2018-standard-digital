According to Mr Chumba, the pilot project will cover two sub-counties before being rolled out to the remaining areas. “Currently, 367 farmers are targeted, with at least Sh105,000 in premiums expected to be paid to the insurance firms involved,” he said. The county has received 18 litres of Dimilin, an insecticide, from the national government. This will be distributed to the four sub-counties, according to Chumba. Avoid fake news!

The blocks have been formed in Kakamega and Vihiga counties. “A village block comprises several households with a view to sharing and exchanging experiences as well as mobilising resources, however little, to help us prevent and control further spread of the deadly pest,” said Zachary Ombete, a farmer from Ebusembe village in Emuhaya sub-county, Vihiga.
