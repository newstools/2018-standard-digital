Only women's groups will benefit from a multi-million shilling free dairy cow initiative. Kakamega Deputy Governor Philip Kutima said the project would no longer target men. “When it was launched, the One Cow Initiative targeted households. However, we found out that menhave sold the dairy cows they were given. This year only women who belong to saccos and organised groups will benefit,” said Kutima. ALSO READ:
