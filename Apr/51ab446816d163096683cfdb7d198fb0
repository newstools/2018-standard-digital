The wrist had been completely severed by a chaff cutter on January 26. “I am happy that the surgical procedure was successful and the patient is healing,” said Ominde, a plastic surgeon, of the latest surgery at Coptic Hospital. Normally, such a delicate surgery would take up to 20 hours, but it took 11 hours. Ominde said they grafted muscles and nerves from the patient’s leg to fill in the gaps left due to the severity of the injury.
