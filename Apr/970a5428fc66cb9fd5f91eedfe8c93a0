Text the word 'NEWS' to 22840 “The bail determination by Chacha will be deferred until a pre-bail report from his family members, mostly his parents, and victims of the fraud is filed,” the magistrate directed. She ordered the Probation Department to dispatch a team of officers to Chacha’s rural home in Masaba village in Kuria, Migori County, to interview his parents, relatives, the local administration, and the victims of the fraud and file a report before she can decide on the bail plea filed by defence lawyers. In the report, Jakoyo Midiwo, one of the witnesses, has registered his reservations about the accused being released on bond. He said he believed Chacha was connected to certain influential people and being granted bail would allow him to try to pervert justice. ALSO READ:
