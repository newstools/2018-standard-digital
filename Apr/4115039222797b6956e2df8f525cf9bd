Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho has hinted that he will vie for the presidency under the Orange Democratic Movement (ODM) party flag should Raila Odinga fail to run.

Even if I win the presidency, I will still support Raila fully,” said Joho during an impromptu visit to Kondele on Wednesday as he sought to consolidate support in Raila’s political backyard. He said the party leaders would continue pushing for reforms in the country, including changing the Constitution. One of the key priorities at the moment, he said, was making the party stronger so it could be a formidable force to reckon with ahead of the next elections. He noted that a strong party would also be a huge boost for Raila "in their quest to ensure that the country goes in the right direction" following the handshake between Raila and President Uhuru Kenyatta.
