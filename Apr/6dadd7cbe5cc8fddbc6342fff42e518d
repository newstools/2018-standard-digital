Families in Maella ward could be displaced due to a crack that has cut off roads and several farms. The two-kilometre fault line in Kipkonyo village has displaced three families and there are fears that it could get deeper and wider. This has prompted the Government to ask those living in nearby areas to move to safer ground. The fault line, which was first noticed on Sunday, is similar to the one that cut off a section of the Maai Mahiu-Narok road last month. Area MCA Kamanu Gathariki said the crack had affected homes and farms between Kipkonyo Primary School and Tangi Tatu village. He explained that the problem started at the weekend after heavy rains, adding that some areas were already inaccessible. “The fault line is literally swallowing up farms and roads and several houses could go the same way if the rains continue,” said Mr Gathariki.

The Naivasha assistant sub-county commissioner, Joseph Opondo, said families had started moving out of the area and that crops had been destroyed by the rains and the crack, whose cause had not been established. “There is a fault line that is currently developing in Moi Ndabibi area and we are working with the county government to assist the affected families,” he said. Opondo urged the affected families to be cautious. “The rains have left a trail of destruction, cutting off major roads. There are fears that this could get worse.”
