Court of Appeal rejects appeal date against Senator Loitiptip He filed the appeal through Senior Counsel Fred Ngatia. The High Court nullified election of Wajir Governor Mohamed Abdi on January 12, 2018 following a successful petition by former Wajir governor Ahmed Abdullahi. Delivering the ruling in January this year, High Court Judge Alfred Mabeya found that Abdi failed to produce original academic forms which means he was not validly elected. Mabeya added that Abdi was not validly cleared to vie for the seat of Governor for Wajir County as he did not possess the educational qualifications. “Abdi was not validly elected to the position of Governor and his election hereby declared null and void,” said Mabeya.
