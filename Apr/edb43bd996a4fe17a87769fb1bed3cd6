Britam employees asked to take early retirement “Imarika allows investors to invest with as little as Sh1,000 with subsequent top ups of any amounts, depending on one’s saving ability. The investment also guarantees a free life insurance cover of Sh50,000, and the interest is not subjected to a withholding tax of 15 per cent,” said Britam Group Managing Director Benson Wairegi. On top of that, the insurer explains that an investor will be allowed to apply for tax relief if the policy is 10 years or more. Unlike traditional life covers where if a client stops making the agreed premiums over a period of time he risks losing the returns associated with the cover, Wairegi explained that under the new venture, a client can stop contributions and pick at a later date, without loss of the contributions. Also, as the fund accumulates, the same client is allowed to make partial withdrawals of up to 30 per cent of the fund value after three years to cater for short term needs or goals. Avoid fake news!
