Big firms have been netted in the latest Auditor General’s dragnet for tax cheats, offering a rare glimpse into the extent of massive breaches in tax payments that might deny the country billions in lost revenues. East Africa Breweries Limited (EABL), Del Monte, Nairobi Bottlers Company Limited, Kenya Power and Lighting Company (KPLC) are some of the large taxpayers that had not fulfilled all their tax obligations by the time Auditor General Edward Ouko published the audit report in November 2017.

The audit showed that Kenya Revenue Authority (KRA) might have lost revenue running into billions of shillings as taxpayers tried to dodge the tax net. Mr Ouko found that the country risks losing Sh18.5 billion in VAT and Sh20.6 billion corporate income tax from the top 25 tax payers in what the auditor attributed to tepid tax collection strategy by the taxman.

However, the large taxpayers objected. Finally, KRA and the large taxpayers settled on a Sh807.8 million, with the large taxpayer remitting Sh69.5 million leaving a balance of Sh738.3 million. The balance had not been collected by the time the audit was done. “The debt has also not been transferred to debt unit for collection nor has it been recorded in taxpayers’ ledger accounts,” reads the report.

Governors face claims of wasting millions British firm Aggreko International Projects wrote a letter to the Cabinet Secretary for National Treasury requesting for a 100 per cent tax waiver of its outstanding tax balance of Sh455 million. KRA wanted them to be given a tax waiver of 50 per cent. Treasury has not responded to either requests. Moreover, the company had not made any payment to reduce the outstanding balance. Gerishon Kirima might have died in 2010, but the taxman still hounded him to his grave with the audit showing that his estate had not paid a tax debt of Sh374.6 million. Moreover, Mr Ouko queried the manner in which the tax liability was reduced from the initial Sh631.8 million. Fruit processing company Del Monte had outstanding total tax liability of Sh430.8 million, Sh253.2 million in corporation tax and Sh177.6 million in PAYE. Del Monte had also not filed tax returns for the year 2015. “In addition, the taxpayer has not filed returns of 2015.
