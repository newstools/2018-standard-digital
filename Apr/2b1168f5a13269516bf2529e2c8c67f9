This was after traders petitioned him over the planned demolitions, saying it would interfere with their businesses. Yesterday, Rasanga said the structures will now be removed to give room for proper urban planning.

Some of the traders were, however, not happy with the governor's directive and wondered why he had changed his mind on the demolitions.
