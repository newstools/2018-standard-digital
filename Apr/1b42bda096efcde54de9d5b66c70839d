He further called on Government to punish those delaying payment to contractors. Delay payments “Accountability institutions should act and penalise Government entities and officers who deliberately delay payments to suppliers and contractors in compliance with the Public Procurement and Asset Disposal Act, 2015,” the chairman said. Icpak has also asked the national Government and county governments to validate all the historical pending bills and resolve them accordingly. ALSO READ:
