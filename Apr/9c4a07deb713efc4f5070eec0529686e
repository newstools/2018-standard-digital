Kiambu Governor Ferdinand Waititu has suspended the County Executive Member in charge of Water, Environment and Natural resources. In a letter dated April 12, and which was seen by The Standard, the Governor ordered John Mugwe to proceed on leave for 30 working days. “I shall have a meeting with you after the expiry of your leave to agree on your performance and set targets,” reads part of the letter signed by the governor.

It is a shock but hoping (sic) that I will continue serving Kiambu people after the 30 days,” Mugwe posted on Facebook. Last year Mugwe shelved his ambitions to be Kiambu governor. Others that shelved similar ambitions to back Waititu for the seat are deputy governor James Nyoro, David Kariuki Ngari, commonly referred to as Gakuyo, and Aquiline Njoki. The group formed a movement dubbed United for Kiambu, which eventually trounced William Kabogo in the Jubilee Party primaries and later in the last August 8 General Election.

The suspension comes in the wake of the resignation of Agriculture CEC Dr Jeremiah Nyori, after what sources described as frustration by senior county government officials.  ALSO READ:
