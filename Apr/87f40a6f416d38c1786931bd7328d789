Marjan had summoned the five officers separately on Monday and advised them to consider taking leave. However, by yesterday, three of them were in office when Marjan went to lock it. “He (Marjan) found three officers in Chiloba’s office and asked them to find a different work station and not on the sixth floor,” said a senior IEBC official.

He did not lock offices or chase anyone. It’s simple institutional load balancing exercise,” said Limo. The “load balancing” of the five came just a day after the commission sought to repossess two vehicles being used by Chiloba who is on a three-month suspension. On Thursday, the IEBC disabled fuel cards used by Chiloba’s drivers while a third vehicle used by one of the CEO’s aides had its GK number plates plucked. Chiloba’s fuel card of was later reinstated by the transport manager after the CEO asked him to explain in writing why the action as taken. ALSO READ:
