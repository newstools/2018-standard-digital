A blogger spent Friday night at the Kapsabet Police Station in connection with a post touching on the character of MCAs and the county assembly staff. Vincent Kipchumba, who goes by the name Murage on social media, was arrested following complaints by an MCA and two assembly workers adversely mentioned in the social media post. Kipchumba was released on a Sh10,000 police bond and is expected to appear in court on Tuesday. In his statement to the police, the blogger claimed he forwarded the post from a different forum and that he did not author it.
