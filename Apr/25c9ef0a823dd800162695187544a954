However, none of the ministry heads were around when the petitions were submitted. University Academic Staff Union (Uasu) Secretary General Constantine Wasonga said the strike was not about to end. “Students should give us at least one year to iron out our differences with the Government so that when they come back, they can learn uninterrupted.

March salaries “Vice chancellors should know that lecturers and other university workers did not go on strike to get their March salaries. Those considering accepting their March salary so as to go back to work before the negotiations are completed should not agree to be intimidated,” Wasonga said. The staff on strike condemned university administrations for blackmailing them and forcing them to resume work. ALSO READ:
