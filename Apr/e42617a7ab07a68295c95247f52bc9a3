Waiguru added that the people of Kirinyaga have moved on from the political euphoria created during the campaign period and are now focused on development. “Politicians should realise that the people of Kirinyaga are tired of the same old stories of who will defeat who in the 2022 elections. We just held our elections just the other month; we need to settle down and focus on development,” she said. The governor who is also the chairperson of the 5th annual devolution conference committee urged county youth not to allow politicians to use them as props in their bid to further their political interests.
