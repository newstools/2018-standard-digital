Eastleigh residents will host a one-day festival tomorrow to celebrate cultural diversity in the area. Eastleigh is predominantly inhabited by the Somali community. According to organiser Ahmed Mohamed, the event dubbed Firi Festival Eastleigh will bring together all communities living and working in the area. "Eastleigh is a known business hub in Kenya. It contributes around 30 per cent of Nairobi Countyâ€™s revenue. The Firi Festival and business expo is meant to celebrate this unique yet diverse neighbourhood," Mr Mohamed said yesterday. He noted that Eastleigh had received negative publicity as a terrorist's hideout. "Some say people here are involved in money laundering and dirty business, which is not true. Somalis are known to be entrepreneurial and we attract many people to trade with us," said Mohamed, a member of the Eastleigh Business Community. Avoid fake news!
