When it comes to feathering its own nest, the Kenyan parliament has never failed to distinguish itself. From salaries to allowances, Members of Parliament have always bridged the political divide to have their way. On several occasions, the Salaries and Remuneration Commission has had run-ins with parliamentarians whenever it sought to reduce some of the perks they are accustomed to in line with reducing a runaway public wage bill. While the National Assembly and the Senate should ideally play complementary roles in the execution of their functions as stipulated in the constitution, it emerges the two are working at cross purposes in at least four investigations that both houses are looking at despite the law being clear that matters under investigation by one house cannot be investigated by the other. A duplication of tasks in both houses is tantamount to wastage of public funds because both housesâ€™ committee members draw allowances for investigating a single matter.
