In 1928, G.B Norman sold the plot to Arnold Bradley, who subdivided it into two plots; 20 acres under LR 3586/1 and 140 acres under 3586/2, the firm said. The 20-acre bit is now occupied by Hillcrest Preparatory school. While being cross-examined by his lawyer Cecil Miller last Friday, Mr Dimitri told Justice Elijah Obaga his late father Horatious Da Gama Rose bought the land between 1978 and 1983 from Barclays Bank International, now Barclays Bank of Kenya, who were the executors of the probate of the late Arnold Bradley.

No. 3583/3 situated in Lang'ata comprising 54.39 hectares or approximately 134 acres. At the time of purchase of the property in 1977/78 there existed two tenancies for monthly rent of Sh1,400 and Sh840 respectively. What became of the two houses that were being leased at that time?" KRA queried. Dimitri also presented to court correspondences of a boundary dispute between his firm and the Hillcrest Preparatory School associated with the late opposition icon Kenneth Matiba.
