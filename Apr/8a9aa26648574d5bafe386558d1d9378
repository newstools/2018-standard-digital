The Registrar of Companies has declined to register members of faction fighting for the leadership of Githunguri Constituency Ranching Company. The High Court in Nairobi on April 16 directed the registrar to consider registering Stanley Njoroge, Joseph Kinyanjui Muthoni, Teresiah Wangu Mathai, Ahmed Chege Gikera, John Rimui Waweru, Henry Wainaina Kihoro, Rahab Njoki Wanjohi, Elijah Ngugi Njoroge and Jane Njeri as directors of the giant Ruiru-based Githunguri company. They were all elected at a special extraordinary general meeting at Kwihota Primary playground on May 23, 2015. However, the registrar in a letter seen by The Standard has declined to register the nine, saying the purported Annual General Meeting or elections held on May 23, 2015 was null and void, as there was a court order stopping the meeting. The order was issued on May 22, 2015 by the Chief Magistrate in Thika. “Despite Mr Ahmed Chege challenging the said elections in court, the High Court has never quashed or invalidated the December 17, 2015 meeting that held the said elections. Therefore, the meeting remains valid, legal and supersedes any other purported meeting and elections,” the registrar says in a letter dated April 23. Mr Chege and his group refused to participate in the December 17, 2015 polls. The land-buying company has been rocked by leadership wrangles for more than five years. Avoid fake news!
