Interior Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang'i has ruled out compensation for residents who lost livestock during security operations conducted in Baringo and Laikipia counties. Dr Matiang’i told the National Assembly Security and National Administration Committee the State was not considering any compensation, as doing so would amount to the Government admitting culpability that its officers were responsible for the losses of the livestock. There was a heated exchange at the committee proceedings, with Tiaty MP William Kamket claiming that security officers killed 6,000 animals. ALSO READ:

I am not taking this matter lightly,” said Mr Kamket. But Matiang’i dismissed the compensation claims, denying that security officers were responsible for the killings. “The information I have so far is that no livestock was lost in the hands of our security officers, but that does not mean that I am trashing the issues raised by the area MP. We will investigate and come back to you with a comprehensive answer,” said Matiang’i, adding: “These were deaths that happened as a result of conflict.” Avoid fake news!
