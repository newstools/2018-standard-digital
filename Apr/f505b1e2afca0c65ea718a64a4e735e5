Mortuary services The scheme does not not pay for mortuary services (for bodies that have stayed more than 10 days) or surgical implants.

In the last financial year, 2016-2017, Sh2.4 billion of the Sh7.2 billion budget went to health. The county has also increased the number of health workers from 977 in 2013-2014 to 1,462 in 2016-2017. Similarly, hospital admissions increased under the same period, from 298,760 to 515,321. "There is a lot of demand for health services and this means those who were not able to access now have the ability," he said. Kibwana said the county government was planning to put in place laws to protect the programme. ALSO READ:
