Economists warn of pitfalls in CA's dominance report Industry reports from the Communications Authority of Kenya (CA) indicate the company behind the Zuku brand is falling behind rivals led by Safaricom and Jamii Telcom in the lucrative and competitive fibre market. According to data from the CA, the number of subscribers to Wananchi Telekom’s Zuku product stood at 55,900 in December 2014, giving the country’s first internet service provider 49 per cent market share in the fixed wireless internet market. The number has since grown to 105,713 subscribers as at December 2017. Over the past five years, however, the total number of internet service providers has increased, with the CA issuing new 4G licences to other firms including Telkom Kenya, Airtel Kenya, and Jamii Telecommunications, opening up the market to stiff competition.
