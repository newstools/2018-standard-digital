The digitisation of title deeds, once complete, will get rid of 'mobile permanent squatters', the Government has said. Speaking and the lands registry in Mombasa Monday, Lands Cabinet Administrative Secretary Gideon Mung’aro said the names of squatters allotted land by the Government will reflect in the registry’s online system.

Squatters in Coast face fresh eviction “Mombasa has mobile squatters who keep shifting from one piece of land to another after being compensated and selling off the land. Soon after we complete digitising all the title deeds into the registry, there will be no such cases,” said Mr Mung’aro. He said that the ministry had developed a system that would show all details of a squatter and once a squatter is given land they cannot pose as squatters again. “A lot of squatters have been allocated land by the Government, but still pose as squatters. We plan that once you are given land by the Government, your identity card shows in the system so you cannot pose as a squatteragain,” said Mung’aro. He said there were laws barring squatters from selling any land allotted to them. Avoid fake news! Subscribe to the Standard SMS service and receive factual, verified breaking news as it happens.
