NAIROBI, KENYA: Matatu owners have vowed to defy a move by the County Government to ban them from operating in the CBD in the next ten days.

Matatu Owners Association (M.O.A) chairman, Simon Kimutai on Thursday expressed his displeasure with the directive saying that he was not aware of any such notice from the County Government. “You just don’t move and say matatus are going to go out of town, to where? You must agree and plan with the stakeholders involved to get solutions,” exclaimed Kimutai. He was further opposed to the proposal that matatus should operate from the previously gazetted 9 termini that were now under the control of the County Government, saying they lacked the capacity to accommodate the over 20,000 matatus in operating in Nairobi.
