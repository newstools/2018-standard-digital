An ongoing real estate development consisting of ten private villas in Ongata Rongai is generating a buzz in the real estate scene and catching the eye of home buyers seeking classy homes within small gated communities. Dubbed "the Ten Villas", the semi-detached high-end homes are being built on three quarters of an acre of prime land along Gataka Road off Magadi Road, just after one crosses over from Karen Estate.

Ten Villas Project Manager Winny Okoth says the villas are attracting growing interest locally and abroad judging from the enquiries of potential buyers. â€œThe key point of attraction for the buyers appears to be our concept of having quality and spacious homes within a small gated community to balance between privacy and exclusivity with sense of a community," she says.

The Villas cost between Sh23.5 to Sh25 million, compared to almost similar developments within small gated communities in nearby Karen which cost between Sh50 million and Sh100 million. Winny says buyers are also betting on considerable appreciation of the property value within a few years to enable them resale the villas at lucrative margins or get decent rental income from them. "Infrastructure developments including roads in the area are lifting property values significantly. The property is also near key facilities such as shopping malls, educational institutions including seven universities as well as leisure spots such as the Nairobi National park," she says.

The floors are laid with premium wood tiling in the living rooms while the rest is covered with high-end ceramic tiles to give off an ambience of luxury and comfort. A perimeter wall of natural hard stones and electronic security systems secure the small gated community. Winny says buyers can purchase the property flexibly through cash instalments or mortgage financing. Email: ally.jamah@gmail.com
