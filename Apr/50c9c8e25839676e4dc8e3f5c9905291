Unfortunately, many owners of small enterprises don’t have the financial muscle to raise capital themselves. They, therefore, rely heavily on external sources of funding, especially loans. The main advantage of a loan is that you’re not giving up any ownership of your company, and the lender has no management control or direct entitlement to a portion of your profits. The only obligation you have is to pay the loan back on time. However, while interest can be deducted as a business expense at tax time, the burden of repayments can be heavy when the business is young and has intermittent cash flow. But keep in mind that it’ll take about five years to save Sh1 million from a monthly deposit of Sh15,000, earning approximately 5 per cent interest. On the other hand, it would take two to five days to borrow Sh1 million if you have a good credit rating. Avoid fake news!
