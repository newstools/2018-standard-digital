‘Employers exploiting legal gaps to fire workers’ NIC Bank, on the other hand, has opened four new branches in Malindi, Watamu, Kilifi and Diani. The report, released yesterday, says following 39 branch closures, more than 1,620 bank employees lost jobs last year in the financial institutions’ effort to contain costs while taking advantage of disruptions by the interest rate cap. “With rising operating expenses in the sector and the expected reduced margins owing to the enactment of the Banking (Amendment) Act, 2015, 11 banks announced plans to downsize. Close to 1,620 bank employees were laid off and 39 branches closed, but the total number of branches in the sector rose to 1,182 in the financial year 2017 from 1,089 in the financial year 2016,” said Cytonn.

The lender let go of 100 staff in December 2016 and a further 150 in December 2017.

According to the banking sector lobby - Kenya Bankers Association (KBA) - its members cut 1,933 jobs between August 2016 and the end of June this year due to the reality of the rate cap. According to Cytonn, Equity Bank lost the highest number of staff, 400, followed by Barclays Bank of Kenya at 301 and Standard Chartered at 300. ALSO READ:

What to do when your company is retrenching The country’s biggest lender by assets, Kenya Commercial Bank (KCB), laid off 223 employees, while Commercial Bank of Africa closed the most branches at 12. Banks took advantage of the rate cap law to declare a crisis and opted to send workers home to manage costs. The layoffs have, however, come at a cost, including severance packages for early staff retirement. “We expect to see a short-term spike in cost to income ratios as result of managements’ tough decisions on staff rationalisation, branch closures and investments in technology. Going forward, these actions will trim the excess fat, making banks leaner and more efficient to face the future,” said Standard Investment Bank. Most employees have now been replaced by agents and mobile banking channels. oguguyu@standardmedia.co.ke ALSO READ:
