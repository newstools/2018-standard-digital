A man was yesterday charged with impersonating a police officer and extorting money from illicit liquor brewers. Barnabas Lugedi, who appeared before an Eldoret court, is accused of masquerading as a police officer from Turbo Police Station and coerced two brewers to give him money failure to which he would arrest them. He allegedly solicited the money from Phylis Mijide and Joyce Akinyi Awino, in Marakusi in Kakamega County on April 3. The accused pleaded guilty to the charges of soliciting money, but denied impersonating a police officer. “I only threatened them so they can give me money but I did not tell them I am a police officer. I am a Form Three student and I was broke. That is why I did what I did,” Lugedi said. But this was before he contradicted himself by saying he was a casual labourer at construction sites. “Are you are a student or a casual labourer? This is confusing and making it difficult for the court to rely on your mitigation. And if that is the kind of job you want to do, then you will be a corrupt officer,” said chief Magistrate Charles Obulutsa. Avoid fake news!
