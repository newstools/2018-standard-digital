Leaders allied to the Orange party have told Deputy President William Ruto that amending the Constitution was inevitable. Legislators Samuel Atandi (Alego), Anthony Oluoch (Mathare), Caleb Amisi (Saboti), Florence Mutua (Busia Woman Rep), Godfrey Osotsi (Nominated), and ODM Secretary General Edwin Sifuna claimed that the Constitution has 20 per cent errors and needed to be amended.

Jubilee and Kanu MPs clash in front of DP Ruto “We all agree that there is need for constitutional change to fix the 20 per cent that is defective in the 2010 Constitution. We want to tell the DP that this will happen whether he likes it or not,” said Mr Sifuna. The MPs were speaking on Sunday at the Mariakani Christian Centre South B, where they attended a service and a fundraiser. They were reacting to reports of Mr Ruto’s rejection of calls to amend the Constitution to expand the country’s governance system and create positions for a prime minister and a deputy prime minister. Ruto, who spoke last week at Kakamega Township Primary School during the homecoming ceremony of Education Cabinet Secretary Amina Mohamed, called on leaders to focus on development issues to benefit Kenyans instead of concentrating on personal interests.
