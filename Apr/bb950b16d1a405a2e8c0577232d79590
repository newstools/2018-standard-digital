A Sh2.1 billion water project will be commissioned in June. The CEO of the Lake Victoria South Water Services Board, Petronilla Ogut, yesterday said the Siaya-Bondo Water Supply and Sanitation Project, which was financed by the African Development Bank (AfDB), had already started supplying clean water to more than 100,000 residents. Deputy Governor James Okumbe (pictured) described the water project as a major milestone. Last week, the AfDB announced that it would invest Sh981 million in another water project in the county to complement the first one. Caleb Wegoro, the bankâ€™s executive director, said the bank was focused on ensuring that there was clean water in the region as well as in other parts of Africa.
