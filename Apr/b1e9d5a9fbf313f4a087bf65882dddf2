Public service vehicles plying the Thika Superhighway will from today use express lanes as the authorities try to address persistent traffic snarl-ups.

Thika Superhighway, Mombasa road get special lanes for buses Transport Cabinet Secretary James Macharia commissioned the marking of express lanes to be used by matatus and buses on Thika Superhighway. Five other major roads in the city will also be marked. Macharia was last evening expected to place a notice and the regulations on how to use the express lanes in the Kenya Gazette. Urban Planning Principal Secretary Charles Mwaura said the development was part of a larger project that will see some roads expanded to ensure that there are enough lanes to be shared between the PSVs and private vehicles. The other roads targeted to have express lanes are Lang’ata, Mombasa, Jogoo, Juja, and Waiyaki Way. Avoid fake news!

Macharia said this was part of the programme meant to decongest city roads. He said the introduction of National Youth Service buses was part of the programme as the Government pilots the introduction of the Bus Rapid Transport System.
