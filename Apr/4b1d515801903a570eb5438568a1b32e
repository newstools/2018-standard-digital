Top lenders hold their own against the rate cap tide "I strongly object and will challenge this through legal channels where the truth will come out. I have no doubt (CMA's) administrative over-reach will be overturned," he said. Mr Munir said the timing and fact that some of the board members were not punished was an attempt to shift blame. Solomon Alubala, former head of treasury at NBK, who was fined Sh104.8 million, said he was waiting to receive the full ruling before seeking legal counsel. "I have not been served with the full decision. When they do that my legal team will interpret. I have already been subjected to the court of public opinion so let me leave it at that," he said.
