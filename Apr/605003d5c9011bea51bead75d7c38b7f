The fate of more than 500 fishermen and traders operating around the populous Karagita Landing Beach in Naivasha hangs in the balance after the High Court ordered its closure. The court ruled that a controversial corridor, located off the Moi South Lake road all the way to the beach, was private property. This follows a prolonged court dispute between an investor and fishermen who have operated on the beach for years. Following the ruling, former Naivasha MP John Kihagi, who was a party in the case, promised to appeal against the High Court decision. Mr Kihagi noted that several families relied on the beach directly or indirectly for their livelihoods. “The ruling by the High Court has caught us by surprise and we shall be heading to the Court of Appeal immediately as this beach is the only source of food for many homes,” he said.
