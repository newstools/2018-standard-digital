More than 300 slot machines used in gambling have been confiscated in four Rift Valley counties. Addressing the press in Nakuru yesterday, Rift Valley Regional Coordinator Mongo Chimwanga said the machines were found in Bomet, Kericho, Nandi, and Uasin Gishu counties. “We had a successful raid in the four counties and managed to confiscate the slot machines. They have been delivered to the regional headquarters and the operation is still ongoing,” said Mr Chimwanga. The official pointed out that most of the business people running the gambling machines were flouting the regulations. Chimwanga said the operators were relying on business permits issued by the county governments but failed to obtain permits from the Betting Control and Licensing Board. “Some of the operators whose machines have been confiscated were operating with single business permits,” he said.
