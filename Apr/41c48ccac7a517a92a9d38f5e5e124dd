The Flying Doctors Society of Africa (FDSA) has raised Sh4.6 million to go to free fistula treatment. The society yesterday recognised businessman Manu Chandaria and his wife Aruna Chandaria, who donated Sh850,000 to go towards treatment of 17 fistula patients. A single fistula surgery costs between Sh50,000 and Sh65,000. Fistula is an injury caused by long and obstructed labour, involuntary control over urination or defecation among some women after delivery. While the condition is treatable, thousands of women suffer it in silence due poverty, lack of correct information about the condition or poor access to treatment. "Fistula mostly affects women in the northern part of Kenya, because communities around there practice early marriages and female genital mutilation, resulting in complications for women during childbirth," said Dr Eunice Kiereini, chairperson of Flying Doctors Society of Africa. She said fistula cases in the region were amplified by limited medical access. Avoid fake news! Subscribe to the Standard SMS service and receive factual, verified breaking news as it happens.
