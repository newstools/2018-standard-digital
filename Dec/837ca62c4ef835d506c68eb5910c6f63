Led by Trans Nzoia FK executive secretary Dr Andrew Wafula said Khalwale has no business in the party since he is busy campaigning for Ruto and Jubilee Party. "His allegiance to another political party and the DP is a disrespect to the party leadership. He cannot pretend to be in FK when he is busy campaigning for the DP. We do not need him in the party," said Wafula during a press conference in Kitale. The delegates branded Khalwale as a rebel and a masquerader adding that he should not be allowed to ruin Wetangula's political ambitions. "He is a betrayer and is chasing his personal interest and we do not want him to ride in our party for personal gains. He should cease to be part deputy leaders and member of the party," one of the delegates said. Avoid fake news!
