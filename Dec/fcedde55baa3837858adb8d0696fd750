In accepting the appointment, Dr. Njoroge said, “I fully concur that digitalisation of finance has great potential in facilitating the achievement of the SDGs. The invitation is also an important recognition of Kenya's success in digital finance and financial inclusion, with lessons that have been useful for other countries.” The appointment is effective immediately, and the Task Force is expected to present its preliminary report of recommendations to the Secretary-General in September 2019.
