The idea is simple: instead of snacks, the vending machines sell brightly colored boxes with prices ranging from two to 200 dollars, illustrating the needs of poor families at home and abroad. Those looking to donate can choose everything from fishing bait (two dollars) to a cow that goes toward feeding a family ($150). Other items include a polio vaccine, a sewing machine or, for local use, a New York subway map.

"Hopefully it will help somebody in a struggling country and hopefully, a rising tide will raise all the ships." That's the power of these machines, said Ryan John Koch, a New York-based spokesman for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, better known as the Mormon Church. "It does ignite the gift of giving in you," Koch said. And with prices starting at two dollars, "anybody can give," he said. The pilot vending machine installed last year in downtown Salt Lake City, Utah, the home of the Mormons, raised $550,000 during the holiday season, Koch said, with an average donation of $25 per person. The project was expanded to five cities to include Gilbert, Arizona, New York, London and Manila. The vending machines will remain in place until December 30, after which all the money raised will be donated to partner organizations, Koch said. ALSO READ:
