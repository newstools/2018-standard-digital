NAIROBI, KENYA: The Government has secured Sh49.5 billion from the German government to fund various high impact projects in the country. The funding will go towards supporting various government initiatives including good governance, devolution, food security and drought resilience programmes, water and irrigation, education, energy, climate change, health, as well as promotion of youth employment and vocational training.

"Following successful negotiations for development cooperation between the Government of Kenya and the Federal Republic of Germany, I am pleased to sign the technical and financial cooperation agreements for 2014, 2015 and 2016, whose negotiations  took longer than expected owing to the issues related to tax and applicable laws," said Treasury Cabinet Secretary Henry Rotich, adding that the total commitments for the agreements is Sh36.4 billion (311.5 million Euros) consisting of Sh29.2 billion (250 million Euros) as loans, Sh3 billion (26 million Euros) as grants for financial cooperation and Sh4.1 billion (35.5 million Euros) as grants for technical cooperation.
