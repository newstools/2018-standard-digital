The ban was lifted on Tuesday after a day of transport crisis. Sonko said he was willing to become “unpopular” in order to make the right decision and decongest the city. On Tuesday, during a Senate hearing, Sonko had said the ban would make Kenyans “physically fit” as they would exercise. ALSO READ:

But young men must walk,” he said. Sonko said he would not allow "laziness", noting bus terminuses in Muthurwa and Railways were just "one kilometre" away from the CBD. “Let’s be active and as your governor, I will not allow laziness. Mtatembea na mtatembea tena (you will walk),” said Sonko yesterday during the graduation ceremony of 10,000 youths from KCB Foundation’s 2jiajiri Programme in Kasarani, Nairobi.
