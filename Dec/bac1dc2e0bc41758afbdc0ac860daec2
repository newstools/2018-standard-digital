Origin, ownership, editors, content and style as The Standard becomes largest in region During this important week in our history, we believe there has never been a better time for the media to stand up to defend their place in society. And yes, no one can wish away the role of the media. Coincidentally, our centennial celebration is happening just a week to December 10 when the Human Rights Day will be observed globally. On December 10 1948, the UN General Assembly adopted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. We take great pride in our role in shaping the history of journalism in Kenya. We will continue checking facts, clicking keyboards and buzzing phones to give you trustworthy news. On this occasion, we call on every Kenyan to abhor any acts that stifle freedom of expression. We have in the past seen cowardly State officials threatening media houses, switching off TV signals during elections and deriding journalists as monkeys with loaded guns. Freedom of speech is protected by the Constitution. Thomas Jefferson of the US once summed up his respect for the media when he said he preferred newspapers without a government to a government without newspapers. A free press is an integral part of any democratic society.  Stay informed while on the go by subscribing to the Standard Group SMS service. Text the word 'NEWS' to 22840.
