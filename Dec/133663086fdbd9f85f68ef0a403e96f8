BENGHAZI- Heavy rain brought much of Libya’s second city Benghazi to a standstill on Wednesday, closing major roads and shutting its airport, officials said. Water flooded the passenger terminal, rising up to 1.5 metres (5 feet), the airport’s deputy manager, Usama Ferjani, said. Parts of the parking lot were also under water. ALSO READ:
