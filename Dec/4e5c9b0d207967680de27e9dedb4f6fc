Lessons Kenya's Vision 2030 can learn from Dubai Mr Kariithi said the fact that 646.16 acres of the 809.5-acre airport was in Athwana ward is part of the reason the leaders supported the proposal to change the name. “He (Musa Mwariama) was not fighting for freedom for Isiolo or Meru but for the whole country. Just as we have Jomo Kenyatta International Airport, Musa Mwariama was a close ally of Jomo Kenyatta and deserves recognition,” he added. Kariithi said the name Isiolo created the impression the airport "belonged" to Isiolo. “Jomo Kenyatta is an inclusive name because he fought for Kenyans' freedom, just like Mwariama. We do not want a name change just for the sake of it. I am happy some of our leaders have embraced the idea,” he said. Kariithi also appealed for more involvement of Merus in business activities at the airport. Avoid fake news!

The national government planned and designed the airport and named it Isiolo. We cannot just wake up and decide to change the name,” he said. ALSO READ:
