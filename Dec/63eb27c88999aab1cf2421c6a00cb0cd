The revelation came at a time the Assembly is preparing to debate a supplementary budget appropriations Bill which was tabled in the House by Onyinkwa on Thursday. Onyinkwa said the void of non-remitted deductionswas among reasons the supplementary budget was sought. While giving highlights of the supplementary budget, the chairman said clearance of pending bills, re-appropriation of Bursary Fund totaling Sh130 million, contribution to the Lake Region Economic Bloc Development kitty, construction of county headquarters, buying Governor John Nyagarama an official car and payment of gratuities amounting to Sh66 million were key issues which prompted the supplementary budget.
