Anxiety as agency reclaims road reserves The area will get a tunnel across the highway to drain the water that tends to flood the road when it pours heavily. Similar work will be undertaken on Kipande Road to drain water into Nairobi River. Videos of people trapped and cars being swept off the road are shared out every year, but little has been done until now. A similar three-mouth tunnel will be dredged across a section of Thika-Garissa road, with the water draining into Chania River. “We have settled on this technology since it also saves the need to dig open trenches which would disrupt traffic flow. We are using a remotely controlled micro-tunnel boring machine,” Grace Mathai, the engineer in charge of Thika road, told Sunday Standard. Your opinion is valuable.
