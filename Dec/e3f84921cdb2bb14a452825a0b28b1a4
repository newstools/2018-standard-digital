Controversy stalks Sicily Kariuki as legislators dig in National Assembly Health Committee Chair Sabina Chege gave the ultimatum to Medical Practitioners and Dentists Board after a closed-door consultative meeting with the Ministry of Health last Thursday. The meeting was premised on claims that doctors are overcharging patients for simple procedures. The consultation was informed by a case of a patient whose family was slapped with a bill of Sh860,000 just 12 hours after the patient was admitted at a city private facility. The directive was quickly followed by an outcry from the Kenya Medical Association (KMA) who protested the move, saying the guidelines in use are those of 2016. KMA President Dr Jacqueline Kitulu said the current guidelines can only be replaced through a process that maintains fidelity to the Constitution. Your opinion is valuable.
