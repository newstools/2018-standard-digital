Murder suspect admitted to hospital after ingesting poison Homa Bay High Court Judge Joseph Karanja yesterday heard that on November 20, 2018, Otunga stabbed Mr Okello with a knife at Wiga village, Kalanya Kanyango location. Okello died instantly. Otunga has pleaded not guilty. Prosecutor Vallerie Ongeti asked the court not to released Otunga on bond, explaining that the detectives handling the case were convinced he was a threat to witnesses. “Your honour, an affidavit sworn by Corporal Omondi Otieno indicates the suspect had a pistol which has not been recovered to this day,” said Ms Ongeti. “There is genuine fear he can use it to interfere with witnesses if he is released on bond terms.” Your opinion is valuable.

I therefore request the court to allow his continued detention since he will be safer under State supervision rather than outside, where people are baying for his blood.” Otunga was remanded until January 21, when the case will be mentioned for a determination on whether he should be released on bond.
