"It's really important to be here because we all support what Global Citizen is doing, it's helping out a lot of people," said Lesedi Mosita, a banker. "I do follow the cause, I have done my share, I have tried to support as much as I can -- but I am mostly excited to see Beyonce." Know if news is factual and true.

Earlier Sunday, Mandela's widow Graca Machel, draped in a bright yellow and blue dress, took to the stage to honour her late husband in front of the near-capacity crowd.

"So I plead with you, don't think of this as just a music festival, this is a call to the hearts and minds of humanity all across the world."
