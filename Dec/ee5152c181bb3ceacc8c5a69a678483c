MCAs plot to have their body recognized by law Ms Ayoo complained that goons broke three plastic chairs and sprayed a choking substance in her officer. But yesterday, Majority Leader Walter Muok, acting Speaker Evans Marieba, MCAs Dan Were (Kakelo Kokwanyo), Julius Gaya (Central Karachuonyo) and Jeff Ongoro (Kanyaluo) argued that the vandalism was stage-managed by the embattled Speaker to seek sympathy. “We suspect Ayoo is behind the vandalism. The police should investigate her over the incident,” Mr Marieba said. The acting Speaker said they had decided to avoid Ayoo to ensure peace in the Assembly. “We have decided to let Ayoo do her business in this Assembly without any chaos. We will continue running away from her whenever she intends to provoke us,” he said. “Ayoo was in the office with about five MCAs allied to her from Wednesday morning till evening.

Ms Ayoo was impeached by a section of MCAs two weeks ago but was reinstated by the Labour relations court.  Her attempts to resume duty have however, been thwarted by MCAs who have vowed not to allow her back to office.
