He said Kemsa had been using money given by the World Bank but it was now depleted. “The World Bank gave us Sh4 billion in 2013 out of which Sh2.6 billion went to the counties,” Mwangi said.

He observed that the country needed sufficient supplies of anti-snake venom because the World Health Organisation had identified 11 breeds of venomous snakes in Kenya. However, the official said the agency was ready to distribute drugs and other products to Kisumu, Machakos, Nyeri and Isiolo, where the UHC pilot project will be launched on Thursday. ALSO READ:
