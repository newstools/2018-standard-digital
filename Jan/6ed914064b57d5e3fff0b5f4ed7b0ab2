The debate on the Kericho Supplementary Appropriation Bill 2017 ended prematurely after chaos broke out at the chambers. Trouble started immediately after the Assembly Speaker Dominic Rono completed reading the order paper and instructed members of the press and the public to leave the chambers before the MCAs could begin their Special Sitting deliberations. Immediately Erick Bii (nominated) and tens of his fellow MCAs leaped for the mace and grabbed it causing a tug- of war-with the Sergeant-at-Arms. During the melee, the mace was thrown through the widow shattering the panes before it was retrieved by Sergeant-at-Arms Assistants and security guards. The MCAs were bitterly spilt between those supporting the upgrading of Sh100M Kerenga Airport and those opposed. Kericho Governor Paul Chepkwony is proponent of the project backed by his allies at the County Assembly led by Kapkugerwet MCA Collins Biegon. However, a team of MCAs led by Roads and Infrastructure Committee Chairman Paul Chirchir are opposed to the project saying that Governor Chepkwony is concentrating on misplaced priorities in his second and last term in office. Earlier, Chirchirâ€™s team had objected to the presence of police officers led by Kericho Officer Commanding Police Station (OCS) Abdirhaman Mohammed. The unamused MCAs kicked out two officers who had entered the public gallery.
