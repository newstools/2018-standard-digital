 Arodi who was being cross examined by Monson family’s lawyer AB Olaba  said: “These officers still remain suspects in the murder of Alexander Monson, that is why we requested for an inquest into the mysterious death.”
 Alexander’s close friend  Enrico Madella Amadei told the court police refused to release Alexander on cash bail.
