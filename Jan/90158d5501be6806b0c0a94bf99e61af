Nine girls rescued from forced early marriages risk losing their Form One places due to lack of school fees.
 The girls, who scored high marks in the 2017 KCPE, are unable to raise the more than Sh40,000 fees demanded from each of them.

 Hellen Gathogo, the director of One More Day for Children, said the girls also need school uniform and other personal effects.
 “We solely depend on sponsors. The girls may have to seek admission in other schools or join form one later. We were given up to Friday to have the girls report in school,” she said.

 Gathogo says the girls’ parents are threatening to forcefully take them back and marry them off if they are not taken to school soon.
 One More Day for Children, an NGO, rescues girls from FGM, forced labour and early marriages as well as those who have been sexually abused. Ms Gathogo warned that such cases are on the rise in the region.
