Women have powerful Cabinet positions earlier held by men, and for the first time a woman heads the Education Ministry. The women are sagacious and competent. ALSO READ:

Don't leave KANU out, Uhuru told Contrary to some whims, those of us who went against the political tide in Luo Nyanza and chose to support Jubilee are not bitter because the President and his deputy acted out of wisdom, and after consultations.

I also wish to rubbish sentiments that the chief administrative secretary position was meant to reward cronies; I believe the President consulted with those, just like him, tasked with protecting the Constitution and the positions aim to aid Cabinet secretaries achieve their goals.
