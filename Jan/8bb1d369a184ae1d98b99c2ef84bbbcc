The county government has rolled out plans to have every household given a mandatory National Hospital Insurance Fund (NHIF) cover.
 Governor Cyprian Awiti said the plan to identify beneficiaries of the programme will involve MCAs, sub-county administrators and national government officials.

 “We have developed an elaborate programme to ensure all county residents are in the NHF medical scheme,” said Awiti.
 He said the health programme is part of his re-election manifesto in which he pledged to improve healthcare of the residents.

 County Health Executive Richard Muga said the initiative is aimed at reducing the costs of treatment, which are high and leave families poor.
 “The programme will reduce poverty in families as a consequence,” said Muga.
 He said the programme is part of the health strategy outlining multi-sectoral approaches employed in improving the sector.
 “One of our strategies is provision of the cards,” he said.
