He never uttered any word, he kept the Sportpesa booklets he was carrying in a safe and left for a drinking den only for him to return at 9pm to pick a quarrel,” Ms Nekesa said adding that he demanded to know where she was that day. “I told him I went to borrow a phone from a neighbour to call him to inquire his whereabouts, as the food was getting cold," she said. She said during the argument she heard petrol smelling and sensed something was amiss. “I put off the tin lamp and left with my child through the back door. I was very traumatised and went to the police station to seek help. On coming back, I heard screams that my house was on fire,” she said. Neighbours said the man had been accusing his wife of having a lover. Angered by her action, he left the house and returned later carrying a plastic container filled with petrol. His brother, Peter Owino, said Mr Otieno entered the house and doused himself with the petrol then lit up a match and started screaming for help shortly after. ALSO READ:
