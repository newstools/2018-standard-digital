Appearing before Principal Magistrate Liz Gicheha she denied the charges and was released on Sh1 million bond with surety of similar amount. The court was informed that there existed another charge of concealing title deeds with intent to defraud. Njeri allegedly on May 16, 2013 in Nakuru with intent to defraud concealed title deeds of two parcels of land located at Miti Mingi Mbaruk. She did not answer to the charges of concealing the title deeds after her lawyer Kamau Chomba applied to have plea deferred. Lawyer Chomba informed the court that his client had moved to another office and has not been able to access her previous office where the titles could have been left. “I apply to have plea deferred, due to her nature of work, she moved to another office and in the cause of relocating left some of her furniture in her previous office and has not been able to access the same,” said Chomba. The court allowed the application and had plea deferred to January 29, 2018. ALSO READ:
