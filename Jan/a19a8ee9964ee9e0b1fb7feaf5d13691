Retail service provider Tusker Mattresses says it plans to grow its branch network to 100 in the next three years.
 Speaking at the first Tuskys CEO Gala Dinner hosted to celebrate the firm’s staff, suppliers and partners on Saturday evening in Nairobi, Tusker Mattresses Group Chief Executive Dan Githua said the firm has revamped its corporate strategy to accelerate growth. Tusker Mattresses operates Tuskys Supermarkets and Mavazi Lifestyle, a clothing store.

 Mr Githusa said the firm will rely on supplier partnerships, human resource development and information technology adoption to guarantee a superior customer experience while cutting down operating costs.
 “These partnerships will include joint investments in automated solutions with suppliers to cut shrinkage rates from five per cent to less than one per cent given that loss control is a key problem dogging the retail sector today,” he said.

 The firm’s three-year operating strategy will be rolled out at an estimated cost of Sh3 billion.
 SHAKE OFF COMPETITION
 With a branch network of 64 stores in Kenya and Uganda, Githua said Tuskys is adopting competitive strategies to shake off competition from local and multinational retail operators.
 To enhance supplier relations, Githua said Tuskys is finalising plans to expand its Sh3 billion supply chain finance facility to provide coverage to all its suppliers next year.
 The facility set to be expanded to about Sh4.5 billion is underwritten by KCB and DTB Bank Kenya currently covers 40 per cent of the firm’ suppliers.
