The rot at Kenyatta National Hospital (KNH)  is definitely deeper, considering the horrifying rape claims that have been recently brought to the public limelight. A move by the Hospital CEO Lily Koros to vehemently deny the claims even before investigations were done is a pointer that there is more than meets the eye in this matter.
