 The parents, led by the school's Board of Management Chairman Charles Sambaya, claimed that some of the money collected could not be accounted for.
 They said teachers employed by the board had since quit because they had not received their pay amounting to Sh350,000, Parents said.
 Asalache dismissed the allegations levelled against him and vowed to stay put despite mounting pressure on him to exit.
 The head teacher said he was not responsible for collecting tuition fees and accused the board chairman of colluding with parents to fight him.
 â€œHow could I have collected tuition fees and squandered the money when I'm the manager of the school?" he asked.
