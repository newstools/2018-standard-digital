In a day we receive reports on at least three cases, with Kakamega being in the lead,” Chimwaga said. He added that a survey was being undertaken to identify the root cause of the suicides and how the deaths can be prevented. “Preliminary investigations indicate that the main causes are domestic feuds, polygamy, peer pressure, and adultery,” he said. According to Chimwaga, the situation has been worsened by a veil of silence around suicide, which is traditionally viewed as taboo.

People have to first accept they have a problem,” he said. Youths and marriage couples have been especially hard hit. ALSO READ:

He directed police to ensure that action was taken to forestall the conflicts or prevent them from escalating.
