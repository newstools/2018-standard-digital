Mystery over youths shot dead by police The injured officers are receiving treatment in Moshi, Tanzania, because local hospitals do not have X-ray facilities. Yesterday, the parents of the victim, identified as Mathendu Ndakuu, denied claims by Coast Regional Commissioner Nelson Marwa that their son was part of the hired goons deployed at the disputed 2,300-acre Sir Ramson farm in Taveta sub-county. Marwa toured the farm on Monday for a meeting with local leaders to resolve the conflict. After the meeting, he addressed the public at Njukini where he claimed the victim "was among those who were hired to attack police officers." He said police fired back because their lives were in danger. Independent sources say Ndakuu was shot once in the chest while harvesting maize on their family plot hundreds of metres away from the violence-hit area. The deceased's mother Jastina Ndakuu said her first-born son had been engaging in farming since he sat his Standard Eight national exam at Chokaa Primary School in Taveta sub-county. ALSO READ:
