 According to one passenger who identified himself only as Yusuf, the bus left Eastleigh at 6am heading to Wajir but developed mechanical problems soon after Thika town.
 “I was seated next to the driver and I warned him severally that the bus was producing very heavy smoke but he ignored. He was even warned by another bus driver heading to Garissa but he decided to proceed,” Yusuf who escaped with minor injuries said.
 The passenger said that several times he noticed the driver struggling with the vehicle brakes.
 The scene of the accident was littered with shards of broken glasses.
 The Standard also noticed that the bus’s front tyres were supported with ropes in a clear case of negligence.  
 The bus driver took off immediately after the accident and police are still searching for him.
