 This was more good news coming after Kenya Railways adjusted the advance ticket booking window from 14 days to 30. The online platform will enable a customer to purchase up to a maximum of five tickets per transaction and pay through M-Pesa.
 Upon payment, the customer will receive a transaction confirmation message through their mobile phone with an option to check the ticket status online.

 Kenya Railways Managing Director Atanas Maina expressed confidence the online platform will go a long way in saving passengers from challenges of booking tickets while on the train.
 “This system is easy to navigate and further enhances the efficiency of booking,” said Maina.
 Customers have been relying on USSD Payment Solution by dialing *639# on their Safaricom lines and paying via Mpesa.
 Others have had to visit the nearest SGR station to purchase tickets over the counter.
 Ease booking
 “The online platform is a popular mode of transacting business and with its addition to Madaraka Express, customers will feel ease of booking,” Maina said.
