 The first incident happened in Kawangware where four suspected thugs were shot dead on Tuesday morning and a motorcycle they had stolen recovered.
 The four were cornered at Gatina by police and killed in a chase at about 3am, witnesses and police said. This was after they had allegedly attacked and robbed a motorcyclist of his motorcycle earlier on in the area while armed with knives.
 Police say the men had been linked to a series of robberies in the area that also prompted the reaction.
