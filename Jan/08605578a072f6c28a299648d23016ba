 "Kenyans are hopeful that the start of 2018 will be a game-changer, especially on the divisive nature of Kenyan politics and hopefully the year will signal a return to normalcy for the country. Kenyans are also hoping that politicians will give them a break for the next five years so as to allow the country to focus on economic development that will spur job creation and the lowering of the standards of living as the country takes a path to recovery,” said Maggie Ireri, Chief Executive Officer TIFA Research.
 On Kenyans who feel 2018 will be better than 2017 on political party affiliation under above factors (economic conditions, employment prospects, political climate, cost of living and security), Jubilee supporters feel  positively at 80 per cent, 78, 77, 77 and 80 per cent respectively.
