The High Court has stopped the NGO Board from freezing the accounts and interfering with operations of the Kalonzo Musyoka Foundation. Lady Justice Roselyn Aburili yesterday said the board did not follow the law while freezing the accounts of the foundation associated with former Vice President Kalonzo Musyoka. “I do issue orders restraining the Non-Governmental Organisations Coordination Board from freezing or interfering with the foundation,” said Justice Aburili. The judge said the board did not have a right to freeze accounts of organisations. Fair hearing Aburili, however, did not restrain the board from investigating the foundation against any wrongdoing of its officials. The judge said the board did not accord the organisation a fair hearing before taking any action. “NGO board being a statutory body must act within the law and any administrative action cannot be fair if a decision is arrived at after a consideration of one side,” said Aburili. On May 3, last year, the foundation’s accounts were frozen after the board accused it of engaging in money laundering and operating illegal accounts. The board also claimed the foundation was unable to account for Sh196 million.
