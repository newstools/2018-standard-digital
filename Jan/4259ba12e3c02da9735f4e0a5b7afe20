 On Friday Mr Omtatah, KRA and Njiraini’s lawyer were in court but the judge requested for more time to complete writing the ruling.
 Omtatah wants the court to compel the KRA board and Treasury Cabinet Secretary Henry Rotich to appoint an acting commissioner-general and send Njiraini, who turned 60 on December 20, on terminal leave.
