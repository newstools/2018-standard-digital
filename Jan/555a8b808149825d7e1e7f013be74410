 “They had been attacking and robbing locals with impunity and we believe they were behind a series of robberies in the area,” said Mohamed.
 Cases of armed robberies have been fluctuating in the city with police reacting with brutal force. Tens of suspects were shot dead by police in separate incidents in 2017 alone in war on crime.
 And police are investigating an incident in which a man was found dead in his house with stab wounds in Kibera slums, Nairobi.
 The man is said to have been found dead in his bed with bloodstains on Monday evening.
 His brother told police he had been trying to reach him through his mobile phone in vain which prompted him to go and check on him.
 It was then that he established he was dead in the house he stayed alone. The body was moved from the house to the mortuary as investigations go on.
