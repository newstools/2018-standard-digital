 "Travellers on the Madaraka Express Passenger Service can purchase a ticket by dialing *639# on a Safaricom line, follow outlined steps as prompted by the system and pay by M-Pesa," he said in the statement .
 Mr Maina said that the USSD payment solution enables one to check availability of tickets on a particular date and allows a traveller to buy a maximum of five tickets in one transaction.
 "Tickets can also be purchased over the counters at the respective departing stations. As a result of the adjustment in the advance ticket booking window, group bookings will now be done 32 days to the travel date and not 16 days as has been," he said.
 The service which has been in operation for seven months has proved to be quite popular with travellers especially during the festive season, with the train being fully booked during this period.
 To date, approximately 660,106 passengers have used the train which operates between Mombasa and Nairobi while making seven stops.
