Murder sparks violent protests The officer is accused of defiling the minor, who had been placed under police custody, after moving her from the cells to clean an area within the station. The incident occurred at the weekend. The magistrate will today make a ruling on whether to detain the police officer for five days as investigations continue. The suspect spent the night at the same police station where he is accused of committing the offence. The victim, who is a Form Two student, is said to have reported the defilement to other officers who then took her to Gatundu Level 5 Hospital for tests and treatment. The officer was arrested shortly thereafter. The defence lawyer, however, opposed the application to have his client detained as investigations continue. He argued that was illegal and contrary to the Constitution. ALSO READ:
