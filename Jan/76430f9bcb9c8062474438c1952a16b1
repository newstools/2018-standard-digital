The former legislator states that Article 3(2) of the Constitution is clear that any attempt to establish a government contrary to the law is unlawful and a treasonable offence. "Even though the respondents claim that they have a right to assemble under Article 24(5) of the Constitution, this right should not be used to affect the rights of others and to go against other provisions of the Constitution," the MP's affidavit reads. The legislator claims actions by NASA co-principals Raila and Musyoka are also a threat to national security and must be stopped.
