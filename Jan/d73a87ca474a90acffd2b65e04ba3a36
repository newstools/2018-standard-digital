EU suspends funding of Sh3.6 billion water projects in Kenya Plans to construct the dam along Kipsonoi river in Bomet County has been riddled with challenges, with conservationists raising concern that the proposed dam is expected to hive off 2,400 acres of the forest. “We are consulting with other Government agencies to identify new sites where the dam can also be put up so that it does not affect the forests,” KFS Chairman Peter Kinyua said in Nakuru during a tour of Mau forest. He was accompanied by Chief Conservator of Forests Emilio Mugo and other KFS officials. “We are also advising on options of acquiring land outside forests so that we can achieve the forest cover goals as well as increase water availability,” said Mugo. The National Water Conservation and Pipeline Corporation,  which is undertaking the project, had been accused by the KFS for failing to involve key players in planning for the proposed dam.
