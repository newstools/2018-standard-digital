A video doing rounds on the social circles showing Nigera's Chibok  girls still in captivity under the militant Islamist group Boko Haram has caused a stir. In the video, a girl dressed in full niqab is seen as appealing to her parents to embrace Islam. Dressed in a blue and white niqab, the young woman’s face is concealed, only her eyes can be seen as she recites prayers in Arabic. "This is to you, our parents” she says asking them to convert to Islam. She said the girls are married to Boko Haram fighters now and do not want to return home because they are being  “treated well.” It is unclear whether the girl was being  forced to speak.  The video shows her surrounded by about 10 other young women, most of whose faces can be seen. Their identities have yet to be confirmed. One of them is holding a small baby and beside her, a little girl of about two years is playing. This is the second video Boko Haram have released in the past two days. The first claims to show a Nigerian air force jet shot down by the militants. Stills of the video published online also show Abubakar Shekau, the leader of one faction of Boko Haram. He is seen standing, holding a gun and refuting claims by the Nigerian army that he is seriously injured. The videos were released through Nigerian journalist Ahmad Salkida, who has had exclusive access to Boko Haram for some time. Of the 276 girls kidnapped in Chibok four years ago, 112 are still missing.
