Chiefs and their assistants must take personal responsibility to eradicate these vices,” he said. The multi-billion shilling betting industry is at the centre of a storm because of a 35 per cent income tax recently imposed by the Government. Gaming companies have protested that the tax is too high. The clampdown on illicit alcohol and gaming began in 2016 after a public outcry on their effect on adults and children.
