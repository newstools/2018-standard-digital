The Government, through the National Irrigation Board (NIB), Â is right to hand part of the Galana-Kulalu irrigation scheme - 20,000 acres - to private developers. Initially, NIB could only manage to do with 5,000 to 10,000 acres and it is a good thing that of the one million acres targeted, we can now have more land in use. Another thing is that private developers will do their best to produce because they have contracts that bind them to what the Government wants them to produce for Kenyans. Third, when we talk Galana-Kulalu, we are talking major farming project and it can only be prudent that Government involves experts so that they make maximum use of land and ensure Unga is at out tables at a rate of Sh75 per 2-kilogram packet as promised.

Raila vows to push on with swearing-in plan The best thing is that private developers will be under the Agricultural Development Corporation, which will reportedly run the show at the multibillion project. I also believe that the Israelites helped Kenyans in imparting expertise in farming, and that will come in handy as the private developers, I bet, will opt to hire the trained hands. I am sure the Government-targeted harvest this year (20 million bags of maize), will be attained under the expert private developers. That is actually what we should look at rather than who is managing the project. It is time Kenyans drop the condescending view they have on food security and look at the whole thing positively.
