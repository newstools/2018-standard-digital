An application for recount was made by 23 voters from Mandera North Constituency. One of the complainants, Issac Hassan Maalim, told the court he was made to sit at a corner during voting and was observing the poll from afar.  He said he was a trained poll agent and had reported at the polling station at about 7.15 am. However, respondents Abdibashir Alinoor and Bashir Sheikh Abdullahi said Maalim seemed satisfied with the voting and would have reported any irregularity observed to the police. Adow Molu Kike, who was an Economic Freedom Party (EFP) agent at Darab Athathi, claimed he was assaulted electoral officials. Mr Kike claimed to have reported the matter at Rhamu police Station.
