 Mr Ochieng said preliminary investigations revealed that on Wednesday morning, Tekia Shighadi had picked a quarrel with her visiting boyfriend identified as Protus Nyangisera.
 “The public caught up with him 7km away from the scene of the murder and stoned him to death,” said Ochieng.
 Nyangisera had paid Shighadi a visit since December 29.
 Cases of murder have been on the rise in the region. Last week, angry boda boda operators went on the rampage and burnt down a house belonging to a suspect believed to be behind the killing of their colleague in the region.
 According to the police, the riders torched a house at Mwakingali village on the outskirts of Voi town.
 Another suspect who was being pursued by the riders had earlier sought refuge at the Voi Police Station.
