MP tells CS Eugene Wamalwa to quit Jubilee "Now the only option left would be for the Political Parties Tribunal to look into the complaints raised," Ms Ndung'u said in a letter to the ANC secretary general, Barack Muluka. Late last year, eight ANC members filed two petitions at Ms Ndung'u's office challenging the appointment of Muluka as secretary general. The appointment is threatening to split the party as some support it while others are opposed to it. Those against Muluka are calling for elections to fill his position. ANC is also facing the threat of protracted legal battles. In the first petition, seven members claimed the minutes of a meeting to pick Muluka were fraudulent and exposed key party officials to criminal charges. On behalf of six other members, petitioner Evans Nyaribo said: “ANC did not conducted free and fair polls to elect new officials as per the Constitution and therefore replacement of former SG Godfrey Osotsi by an interim one violated the law.” Yesterday, Kakamega Senator Cleophas Malala said the party should have fresh elections to pick its office bearers. “If this matter is not resolved, it will destabilise the party. The best thing is we should have elections at all levels and elect our officials,” said Malala. ALSO READ:
