One child died on Wednesday while four others were admitted to Tenwek Hospital after receiving the jab at a health centre in Konoin. Barchok said a post-mortem examination would be conducted today by a Nairobi-based pathologist at Tenwek Mission Hospital to establish the cause of death. County concerned “We are concerned about the incident as a county. We would like to know why the vaccines that were yet to expire caused such a reaction in the children,” said the deputy governor. Doctors said the four children who were admitted to Tenwek in critical condition were responding well to treatment. Parents of the affected children are demanding answers from the county government.
