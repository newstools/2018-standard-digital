Under Nemis, school principals and head teachers have been given up to February 20 to finish registering their students. The new system gives students in primary and secondary schools a unique identification code that can be used to track their progress at all levels of education. Launching the new portal, Education Principal Secretary Belio Kipsang said the initiative was part of the Kenya Primary Education Development Project (Priede) that is funded by the World Bank. Dr Kipsang said Nemis would also be used to assess the performance of the education system, harmonise student data and closely monitor distribution of resources. “We have about 10 million pupils in primary school and 3 million in secondary school; combined with those in private schools we have close to 15 million. We want to harmonise these figures and have a single source of data,” he said. The system will be accessible to parents and education stakeholders. “Anyone can log into the system depending on the nature of information they want. Parents will also be able to track their children's performance anytime online.” ALSO READ:
