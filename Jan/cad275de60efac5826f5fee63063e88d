Kakamega, Kenya: A 55-year-old woman who went missing last week has been found dead and the body dumped in a pit latrine. The woman comes from Mukhweya village in Matungu. Relatives said they suspected a family member was behind the killing over a land feud. Those who spoke to The Standard yesterday alleged the woman was killed for rejecting plans to have the land leased. “A land feud erupted last year but we decided as a family to demarcate it and give the warring parties their share,” said the woman's step-daughter. She added that the family suspected something was amiss when a relative re-constructed the latrine, which was not in need of repair. She said the suspect took off when neighbours questioned him on the woman's whereabouts. ALSO READ:
