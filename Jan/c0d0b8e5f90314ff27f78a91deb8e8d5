 Mr Muriithi said the plan would make sure no animal would die due to drought, as has been happening.
 Agreed time
 “The commission will buy cows from farmers in these regions at the agreed time. We are still working out the amount that will be paid per animal,” Muriithi said yesterday.
 He said they would sensitise farmers and convince them to sell their livestock to avoid  losses.
 During a meeting in Nanyuki Town, an economic bloc was mooted to boost investment, livestock production and tourism.
 Baringo governor Stanley Kiptis, Samburu deputy governor Julius Leseeto and Isiolo deputy governor Issa Abdi were also present.
