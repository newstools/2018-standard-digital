 Among those moved was driver of the trailer Maalim Ayub who was buried on Monday in Garissa. The driver died on the spot together with his co-driver identified as Omar during the Sunday dawn accident.
 Ayabei said officials were working closely with morgue attendants and local administrators to trace family members of those who died in the accident that claimed 36 lives.
 He said the Kenya Red Cross ambulance stationed at Salgaa would continue operating along the Nakuru-Eldoret route for any emergencies. The ambulance was stationed along the ‘killer’ highway two weeks ago.
 Rift Valley Traffic Enforcement Officer Zero Arome urged road users to be careful and observe road signage while approaching black spot areas. These include Ngata, Sobea, Teachers, Salgaa, Migaa, Sobea, Sachangwan and Kamara.
