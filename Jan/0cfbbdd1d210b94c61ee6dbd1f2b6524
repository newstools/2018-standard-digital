Kenyans may not have to travel to India to seek kidney treatment after the Kenyatta National Hospital (KNH) in Nairobi received two modern machines. The acute multi-therapeutic Continous Renal Replacement Therapy (CRRT) Amplya machines will also be used in the treatment of sepsis, multiple organ failure, trauma and lupus. ALSO READ:

He explained that they have been relying on hybrid machines for dialysis. Angelica Medical Supplies Ltd executive director Mary Matu said procurement of the machine was an initiative of East African Kidney Institute in conjunction with the Ministry of Health after they received a grant from African Development Bank (AfDB). “The equipment is set to revolutionise renal care in Kenya. I thank the Government through the ministry for the support in ensuring that this equipment is available for Kenyans,” said Ms Matu. Forty health workers have already been trained on operation of the machines. Whereas it used to cost more than Sh200,000 in private hospitals to treat kidney failure, she says patients will only part with Sh100,000 or less at KNH with a session of general dialysis costing Sh10,000 against Sh20,000 in private hospitals. The AfDB has funded centres such as one for cardiology in Tanzania, a cancer unit in Uganda and e-health centre in Rwanda. ALSO READ:
