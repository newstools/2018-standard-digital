Nandi residents have raised the alarm over shortage of drugs that has hit public health facilities over the past three weeks.
 The shortage has affected about 150 health facilities out of the 196 across the county, with patients forced to buy drugs from private chemists.
 A spot check by The Standard in select hospitals and dispensaries across the six sub-counties of Aldai, Emgwen, Tinderet, Chesumei, Nandi Hills and Mosop confirmed an acute shortage of drugs.
 “I came here after experiencing severe headaches but I was surprised that the hospital lacks even painkillers. I am now forced to buy all the drugs the doctor prescribed,” complained Shadrack Tanui at Kabirirsang Hospital.

 County residents and leaders now want Governor Stephen Sang to explain the whereabouts of Sh120 million worth of drugs and medical supplies that he announced publicly that he had procured for use in public hospitals.
 “I am appalled that a majority of public health facilities are experiencing an acute shortage of drugs,” said Nandi Senator Kiprotich Cherargey. Governor Sang confirmed the county had indeed spent over Sh120 million to procure drugs and termed reports of shortage as "fake". Attempts by The Standard to reach Kenya Medical Supplies Authority to shed light on the matter were futile.
