The family was returning to Nairobi after spending Christmas at their rural home in Kawese village. On Sunday, neighbours thronged Odol’s home to pay their last respects. The grief-stricken villagers described the deaths as shocking. Joyce Mandera, Odol’s 80-year-old mother, watched in disbelief as the bodies of her son and grandchildren were lowered into graves. Odol’s cousin, Nelson Kabaka, said they delayed the funerals to allows Ms Achieng to recover enough to be part of the ceremony. “The widow was finally discharged from hospital last week. We wanted her to be part of the plans,” he said. “We have not witnessed this kind of loss before. Relatives and elders have worked together to make the day a success,” he added. ALSO READ:

We thank all those who chipped in to support us.” Odol, a mason in Nairobi, was Ms Mandera’s only surviving child. She described the deaths as a major blow to her family. Odol lived with his family in Nairobi’s Mukuru Kayaba slums. He was also the bishop of Faith Holy Ghost Church, Kayaba. Mandera recalled her last moments with her son and grandchildren. “We prayed together before they began their journey back to Nairobi. My son was my only support,” she said.
