Survey works for the proposed Bonyunyu Dam continued for the fifth week under tight security even as residents continued to protest against the project. The dam will be constructed at a cost of Sh5 billion and is being funded by the Dutch government. ALSO READ:

County sets aside Sh70 million to construct offices Tension has been high in the area after one person was shot by the police two weeks ago following a confrontation between locals and armed officers guarding surveyors. The locals have been barricading roads and violently turning away workers at the site, prompting increased security. Even as Lake Victoria South Water Services Board (LVSWB), the lead agent of the project, continued to forge ahead, local leaders insisted concerns raised by the locals must be considered. Kitutu Masaba MP Shadrack Mose said the people from the area must be given a lot of attention on the various issues they have raised. “As much as the dam can be a good project in this place, residents’ views are even more paramount and should be upheld,” said Mose. He was addressing the family of Patrick Onsombi who was shot during a protest. “There is no stone we are going to leave unturned to get justice.” LVSWB Director Victor Omanwa promised an amicable resettlement plan for the people who would be affected by the project.
