Shinyalu MP Justus Kizito is among scores of mourners injured when chaos broke out at a funeral in his constituency. Trouble started when former MP Anami Lisamula arrived just as Kizito prepared to take to the podium on Saturday. Lisamula's supporters restrained the MP from addressing mourners before violence erupted. They first booed him before a fight ensued. The legislator would then be frogmarched out of the compound. "I was about to address mourners when Lisamula's goons pounced on me," Kizito said. He added: "Lisamula himself did not beat me. However, it is a pity that a leader of his stature can cause chaos at a funeral." He was taken to a hospital within Kakamega Town and was yet to report the matter to the police by the time of going to press. Lugari MP Ayub Savula and his Matungu counterpart Justus Murunga, who arrived at the funeral in a helicopter, were forced to leave in a hurry. Scores of youths were injured during the melee. They were treated at the nearby hospital and discharged. But Lisamula dismissed claims he was behind the chaos.
