The buzz word in business, particularly in the agricultural sector today, is ‘value addition’. While the concept of value addition is good in maximising profit for the farmer, there are those who attempt to push their luck too far, often with dire consequences to the consumers of their products. For this reason, there is a need for regulatory bodies to ensure the products in the market conform to set health standards. Unfortunately, some of these regulatory agencies do not seem to take their responsibility seriously. It is alarming that some farmers and traders in milk products are contaminating the product in their attempt to make more money and, therefore, putting the health of consumers at risk. Some are using the chemical formalin, used mostly in mortuaries, to prolong the shelf life of milk. Some of those driven by the acquisition of super profits have been known to add water to milk. The danger here is that the water is untreated and can infect the milk with harmful bacteria. The cost of treating diseases such as brucellosis, which is linked to the consumption of contaminated milk, is beyond the reach of many. The State, through the regulator, the Kenya Dairy Board, should act expeditiously and deal firmly with the unscrupulous businessmen who are knowingly exposing unsuspecting Kenyans to poisonous substances in their mindless quest for profits.
