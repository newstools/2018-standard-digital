 When the prosecutor read the charges, Balola, who had no lawyer, retorted: "I agree and I do not see the need to fight the Government."
 The charge was read to him three times and elicited the same response. He also claimed to understand the charge.
 Balola was arrested in Amkeni, Lamu, on December 12 last year.
 According to the police, he was found with a pair of police trousers, a blood-stained jungle shirt, bullets and a gun.
 The magistrate criticised the police for not presenting exhibits in court yet they were dealing with a sensitive matter.
 She said she would give her judgement once the exhibits were brought to court.
