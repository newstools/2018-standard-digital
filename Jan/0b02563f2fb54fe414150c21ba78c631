Omar through his lawyer Yusuf Abubakar had filed an application seeking to have Judge Lydia Achode withdraw from the case over open bias in handling the applications. Mohammed Balala who is representing Governor Hassan Joho would however dismiss the claims, saying the call for the recusal was a move aimed at intimidating the court. Judge Achode dismissed the application calling for her disqualification from the case, insisting Omar should have gone to the appeals court. “The petitioner has never appealed any ruling by the court to express his dissatisfaction,” she said during the ruling. “It was not enough for the former senator to make mere allegations. He should have given reasonable grounds that there is bias,” she added. ALSO READ:
