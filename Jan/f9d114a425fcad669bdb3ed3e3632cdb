Nyewasco was the only company that had less than 25 per cent unaccounted for water, which is the allowable loss, according to the water services board guidelines. Omwasco had the highest loss - Sh121 million. Auditor General Edward Ouko reported that Omwasco’s financial statements indicate the company had Sh102 million operating revenue from water sales. Operating revenue “Omwasco produced five million cubic metres of water. However, out of this volume, only 2.3 million cubic metres were billed to customers. The balance of 3.6 million cubic metres, which accounts for 61 per cent of the total water produced, was unaccounted for,” the report stated. Mawasco managing director David Gathogo defended the company, saying it was working to recover the debts, but that most of them were bad. ALSO READ:
