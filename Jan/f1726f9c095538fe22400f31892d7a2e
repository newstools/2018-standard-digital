The Kilifi County government is now fully constituted after Governor Amason Kingi oversaw the swearing-in of 10 executives on Thursday evening.
 Kingi and elected leaders present at the ceremony told the new Cabinet to work together and implement the county agenda.

 Governor Kingi obeyed the two thirds gender rule in the appointments, as half of the executives are women.
 County Assembly speaker Jimmy Kahindi said the new executives are qualified and will deliver on their mandate.

 “During the 2013 vetting of CECs we had a problem as the County Assembly since many candidates, despite having requisite academic qualifications, were not able to explain why they needed the job and how they would work to serve the people. That is why most of them had a rough time with MCAs,” said Kahindi.
 In the new Cabinet are two renowned academics -- Prof Josephat Mwatela who was the vice chancellor of Mombasa Technical University and Prof Gabriel Katana formerly of Pwani University.
 Prof Mwatela will head the Public Works and Transport department as Prof Katana takes Education and ICT.
 Kahindi said that despite the current crop of CECs having easily sailed through the vetting process, they will have to prove to the electorate that they are up to the task and help Governor Kingi to deliver his election pledges.
 “For the Governor to leave a legacy, his team of CECs must work and I am confident they will,” he said.
 Kingi warned the executives that they will be fired if they don't serve the people well and help him implement his manifesto.

 “If you score below five out of 10 during the evaluation process, I will have no other option but to fire you,” Kingi said, adding the county resources must be put in their proper use.
 He said he will fight to protect his legacy.
