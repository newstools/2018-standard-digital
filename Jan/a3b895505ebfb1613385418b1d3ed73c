 Rongai OCPD Japheth Kioko asked road users to observe traffic rules while using the ‘killer’ stretch.
 Mr Kioko said it is unfortunate that despite civic education conducted by different stakeholders along the route, accidents were still rampant as a result of carelessness.
 “Road signage has been placed along Nakuru-Salgaa-Sachang'wan-Kamara route that should be observed to avoid deaths,” said Kioko.
