An inter-agency task force tasked with merging the functions of existing organisations that run parallel roles has been established. The financial agencies to be merged include the Kenya Industrial Estates, the Development Bank of Kenya, and the Industrial Development Bank of Kenya. The others are Uwezo Fund, Youth Enterprise Development Fund, and Women Enterprise Development Fund. This is expected to increase efficiency and eliminate overlaps. The first task of the inter-agency task force is to review the regulatory and institutional framework involved in the process to make the merger and transition seamless. Head of Public Service Joseph Kinyua has issued a circular to the affected agencies informing them of the decisions to be implemented in the interim period. ALSO READ:
