Senator Kipchumba Murkomen has told counties ravaged by cattle rustling to set aside funds and complement Government efforts to restore peace.
 The region has witnessed a resurgence of cattle raids that have left more than 100 people dead in the last one year and more than 5,000 head of cattle stolen.

 Speaking after a series of peace meetings along the borders of Baringo, Elgeyo Marakwet and West Pokot counties on Saturday, the senator said despite the national government deploying more security officers in the region, insecurity continued to deny residents peace.
 Mr Murkomen urged the three counties to create a department and establish a kitty to facilitate homegrown solutions to peace.

 “Even if security is a national government function, these counties should do more because they cannot attract investors or exploit tourism potential in the prevailing environment. Generally, there is no meaningful development until they agree on joint efforts that can guarantee peace,” said Murkomen.
