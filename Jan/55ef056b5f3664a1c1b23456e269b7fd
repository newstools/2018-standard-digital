National Assembly Agriculture Committee Chairperson Silas Tiren has hit out at millers for raising maize flour prices, terming them as unfair and aimed at taxing poor Kenyans. The Moiben MP said it was unfortunate that the millers were out to gain profits at the expense of wananchi, yet they still had subsidised maize in their stores. “We expected that the subsidised maize would last until February. It is unfortunate that the millers are taking advantage of Kenyans, raising the prices to almost double yet they still have and some are still taking the subsidised maize,” said the legislator. He urged the millers to first exhaust the subsidised maize.
