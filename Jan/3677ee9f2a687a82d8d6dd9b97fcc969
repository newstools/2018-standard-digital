Although the land is in Naivasha, the court directed that the elections should be held at Gatanga Catholic Social Hall in Murang’a County, where the majority of members come from. The judge further ordered that the main agenda of the day should be electing new directors before any other matter is addressed. Robert Ndung’u from Nairobi was named as the returning officer for the elections while the Gatanga OCS was directed to provide security. “The general meeting report should be filed in court by the presiding officer within seven days of the elections. The company's accounts remain frozen,” said Ms Korir. The order came a month after the members petitioned President Uhuru Kenyatta to intervene so they would not lose their land. Members said the directive gave them a chance to pick directors of their choice. “The land was bought in the early '80s and some of the elderly members have died waiting for justice," said outgoing chairman Samuel Monyo.
