Both agreed to create sand banks for sand dealers to be able to get the multi-billion-shilling commodity from those stations instead of illegally scooping from the rivers. “We take a common position on conservation and utilisation of natural resources as a trans-boundary need that requires regional approach,” read the statement signed by the two executives. They further explored possibility of value addition to sand which might involve coming up with ceramics industrial production and related products to create wealth for the two counties. The meeting was attended by Makueni Governor Kivutha Kibwana and his deputy Adelina Mwau. The leaders urged Machakos and Kajiado counties to team up with the two devolved units to ensure sustainable sand harvesting, environment and climate change management.
