Dean of Students Mark Otieno, who was at the scene, said the students had just finished their picnic when the two reportedly fell into the river. Dr Otieno said one of the students dived into the river to rescue a drowning colleague but was swept away by strong currents. “A third student jumped into the river but was lucky because he clung to a tree and was saved by colleagues,” he said. The dean said the two first year students came from Mogotio in Baringo and Sagana in Kirinyaga counties.
