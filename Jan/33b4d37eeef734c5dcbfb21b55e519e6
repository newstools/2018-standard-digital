South rift small-scale tea farmers have petitioned Kenya Tea Development Agency (KTDA) to release interim-bonuses in April. The farmers, led by Kenya Union of Small-Scale Tea Owners chairman Joel Chepkwony, demanded Sh10 per kilo of tea supplied by the farmers to the agency’s factories. ALSO READ:

Rowdy MCAs interrupt debate, cause fracas inside chambers Farmers in central received a mini-bonus of Sh5 in April last year. Chepkwony, warned that if KTDA will fail to meet their demands, the farmers will withdraw green leaf supply to the agency factories and opt for private entities. Tens of private owned tea factories have sprouted in south rift over the years. “The directors of KTDA factories in Kericho and Bomet scrapped the mini bonus but we want the agency to reinstate it otherwise we will give our tea to private tea factories,” he said. A source at the KTDA who sought anonymity since he is not authorised to speak to the press said the agency only pays mini-bonuses for factories which request for it. “If farmers pass a resolution, the agency cannot deny them. After all it is their money,” he said.
