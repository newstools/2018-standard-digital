A case where a poll loser argues witchcraft was used to influence voting will be determined on February 1 this year.
 Narok County Assembly Majority Leader Wilson Letulal Ole Masikonde moved to court to challenge the win of Orange Democratic Movement's (ODM) Wilfred Kikaet Ole Kuyo, arguing that witchcraft influenced voter turnout on August 8, 2017.

 In his ruling, Narok Principal Magistrate Tito Gesora said the judgement should take place within six months from August 9, when Mr Kuyo was declared winner of the ward representative seat.
 “I will have to extend to late hours to give the judgment on February 1,” he said.

 Masikonde had also named Independent and Electoral Boundaries Commission (IEBC) Narok North Constituency Returning Officer Mark Lempaka as the second respondent in the case, saying the commission failed to conduct the elections in accordance with the law.
 But in his testimony, Kuyo said the elections were free and fair and no one was influenced, either through witchcraft, bribery or any other form of manipulation to vote for him.
 He told Principal Magistrate Tito Gesora that the case was not brought to court in good faith and was based on rumours and hearsay.
