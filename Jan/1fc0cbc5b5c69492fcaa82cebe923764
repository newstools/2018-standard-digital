Human Rights Activist Okiya Omtatah moved to court Monday challenging Uhuru’s creation of Chief Administrative Secretary (CAS) positions, arguing that it is unconstitutional. ALSO READ:

Omtatah sued The President, Attorney General Githu Muigai and Speaker of the National Assembly Justin Muturi over the ‘unwarranted positions’. According to the activist, “the formation of the position of Chief Administrative Secretary in all Government ministries in consultation with the Public Service Commission (PSC) is invalid, null and void.” He asked the court to quash the President’s decision and stop Mr Muturi from receiving or considering the names of the nominees when forwarded to him. On Friday when the Head of State was announcing the list of CSs, he noted that “the chief administrative secretary would broadly be responsible for helping the cabinet secretary to better coordinate the running of affairs of their respective ministers.”
