Two Murang’a MCAs and a Jubilee Party official have accused police of taking too long to arrest people who attacked them last Friday.
 Gatanga MCA Nahason Gachuhi, Kamacharia’s Gerald Wambugu and county Jubilee Deputy Secretary General Charles Njoroge said they were unhappy with the way police were handling the matter.

 The two were attacked and injured during a county assembly strategy meeting at Sahara West Hotel in Ruaka. They were taken to hospital where they were treated and discharged. “I wonder why the police are taking so long to arrest the goons who nearly killed us,” said Mr Gachuhi, adding that the police had promised to arrest the suspects as soon as they recorded statements but nothing had happened.
 They reported the matter at Runda Police Station on Friday.

 “The goons must be arrested and charged in court for attacking us. The police should use the video recording of the attack to nab them,” said Gachuhi, who claimed he had information that the attackers had been hired by a Murang’a MCA who lives in Ruaka. He also claimed he was robbed of a mobile phone and Sh17,000.
 Mr Njoroge said a senior Government official and an influential businessman were behind the fracas and maybe also the delayed arrests.
 “We want the police to tell us why they have not arrested the culprits. They have refused to do their job,” said Njoroge.
 He also wants the police who were present during the attack held accountable for failing to act.
 “It is obvious the police were compromised, otherwise the attack would not have happened. They just watched as the criminals attacked us.”
