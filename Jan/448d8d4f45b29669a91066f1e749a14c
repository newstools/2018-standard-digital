 The KNBS report for the third quarter says that growth in the construction sector fell to its lowest level, recording an expansion growth of 4.9 per cent compared to a 7.8 per cent growth it recorded in the third quarter of 2016.
 The construction sector was affected by the political activities that created uncertainty in the country: “The slowed growth was partly due to the extended electioneering period, prompting investors to scale down construction activities.”
