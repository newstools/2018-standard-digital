 One of the six survivors was admitted to Mama Lucy Hospital in critical condition. The eight were workers hired to demolish the house, to pave way for construction of a new one.

 “Eight workers were demolishing the house and unfortunately it fell on them. They were rushed to Mama Lucy Hospital but two died on arrival. One of the injured is in critical condition, but five are stable,” he said.
 Kenya Defence Forces (KDF) personnel were called in to help with rescue operations.
 Paul Macharia, a resident, said he owned a stall that sold fruits in the collapsed building.
  “I have been operating a fruit stall on the ground floor and l knew by the time they’re through with demolishing mabati on the upper floor, l would have moved. However, it came down before moving. But l escaped unhurt,” he said adding that he lost fruits worth Sh8,000.
 At the scene were ambulances from the Kenya Red Cross Society, St John’s Ambulance and the National Disaster Management Unit.
