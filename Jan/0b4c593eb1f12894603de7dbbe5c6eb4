Two Jubilee politicians from the Mt Kenya region yesterday clashed over the region’s backing Deputy President William Ruto’s 2022 bid for State House.
 Gatundu South lawmaker Moses Kuria was apparently angered by his Nyeri Town counterpart Ngunjiri Wambugu's comments suggesting that Ruto was not guaranteed to get the region's backing in 2022.

 “I want to tell Wambugu that we (Mt Kenya) are not being forced to elect Ruto as the next president. It is our will since Ruto stood with President Uhuru Kenyatta when everybody had abandoned him,” said Mr Kuria, who spoke in the presence of Wambugu and Nyeri Governor Mutahi Kahiga in Kingongo, Nyeri County.
 Kuria was riled by Mr Wambugu’s Saturday Facebook post where he said his vote in 2022 would go to a leader who was committed to ensuring President Kenyatta's legacy was secured and one who promoted national unity and guaranteed Kenyans the right to live anywhere in the country.

 “My vote - and for those that I can influence - will depend on the points above. Period. Nobody is or has ever been supported for the presidency of any country 'unconditionally',” he said.
 He went on: “Most importantly in 2022 my vote will not depend on betrayal or paying debts; there's no such thing in politics.”
 However, Kuria said the lawmaker was mistaken and Mt Kenya was honour-bound to back Ruto’s bid for the top job.
 Kuria said Wambugu’s comments were alarmist and downplayed reports of a rift in Jubilee Party.
 “He (Ruto) is also the right person for the seat. We have no option but to help him ascend to the presidency. We don’t want sideshows,” Kuria said. But in a rejoinder, Wambugu said that Kuria had misunderstood him.
