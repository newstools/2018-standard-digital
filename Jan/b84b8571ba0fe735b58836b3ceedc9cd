— South African Government (@GovernmentZA) January 23, 2018 In his time, Hugh Masekela was known as South Africa’s “father of jazz” for his unending appetitte of the soulful music. Hugh's music was inspired by the turmoil that South Africa underwent during  apartheid, which  he said would be used as a weapon to spread political change. He will be remembered by many for his most famous song "Soweto Blues" sung by his former wife, Miriam Makeba, which is a blues and jazz piece that mourns the carnage of the Soweto riots in 1976.
