A recount of votes in the senatorial race has revealed the margin between the two top candidates has significantly reduced. The High Court in Eldoret had ordered a recount in 11 polling stations after former Senator Henry ole Ndiema challenged his successor Michael Mbito's win. Justice George Kimondo also ordered fresh tallying of results across the county and a scrutiny of forms 38B and 38C to ascertain votes each candidate got. The recount, overseen by the deputy registrar of the High Court and witnessed by agents of the petitioners and the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC), was conducted between December 27, 2017 and January 5. The report presented in court on January 12 indicates the margin between Ndiema and Mbito, as per the results announced by IEBC had reduced with 351 votes after the recount. IEBC announced Mbito as the winner with 71,471 votes against Ndiemaâ€™s 70, 846, resulting into a margin of 625 votes. Scrutiny report However, the scrutiny report seen by The Standard shows Mbito got 71,456 votes while Ndiema got 71,182 votes, a difference of 274 votes. Ndiema's lawyer Morindat Oiboo said the report will be key in supporting their pleadings. Stations where fresh counting of votes was carried out are Njoro, Nai, Matisi, Salama, Titimet, Mutua, Muungano and Lukosi primary schools as well as two streams at Eugene Wamalwa polling station and Kitale Water Works polling centre. Lawyer Stephen Gitonga, for Mbito, lamented the petitioner's agents had written letters to the court without serving them. Kimondo said the case could not be opened for further hearing. He said the respondent should raise the issue in his final submissions. The judge also ordered that all the parties be served with copies of the letters. The matter will be mentioned on January 30.
