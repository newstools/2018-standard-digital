 “We do not have time for cheap politics on who gets this position or that position. That is useless talk,” he said.

 The DP said their main agenda and commitment was to fulfill the Jubilee Party manifesto whose focus is job creation, industrialisation and development. “Our main debate will only be the debate that will focus on job creation to the millions of jobless youth through industrialization and development,” he said.
 Ruto made the remarks at Gathiru-ini village, Komotha in Githunguri constituency Kiambu County when he attended the funeral of Alice Wambui Gicharu the mother to Dr Simon Gicharu, the founder of Mount Kenya University.
 The DP cautioned leaders against divisive politics and fanning animosity among communities.
