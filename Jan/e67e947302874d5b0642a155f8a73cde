Kenyans of goodwill have responded to the touching story of Grace Akinyi Owino, the poor girl who walked from Busia to Butere Girls High School seeking to quench her thirst for education. Acting Education CS Fred Matiang’i was among tens of callers that rang the school after reading the emotional story published by The Standard yesterday.
 High Court Judge Boaz Olao and Chief Magistrate Francis Andai under the Abamulembe group, have also offered to assist the 15–year-old girl. They are set to visit the school next week to meet her.

 “We have received numerous calls from Kenyans of all walks of life; we thank The Standard for highlighting Akinyi’s case,” said the school Principal Jenifer Omondi.
 According to her, some of the callers asked for the school’s account number so they can bank the fees directly. The chairlady of Butere Girls alumni Judge Hellen Wasilwa said the school would fully support Akinyi’s education.
