Government officials are investigating a children's home following claims that one of its sponsors sexually harassed a teenage girl. The sponsor was suspected to have taken advantage of the 19-year-old girl he had pledged to support by paying her secondary school fees. ALSO READ:

The girl's mother said her daughter was rescued after another girl emerged with claims that she too had been sexually assaulted by the same man after he promised to pay her secondary school fees. The Kangema children's officer, Charles Maina, said he had conducted investigations on the safety of the children at the home before presenting a report to the sub-county advisory committee. The Kangema deputy sub-county commissioner, William Lenaremo, said investigations into the allegations were going on and that the home risks being deregistered if the sponsor is found to have sexually molested the girl. “The area advisory committee, which I chair, will visit the home as part of the investigations,” said the administrator.
