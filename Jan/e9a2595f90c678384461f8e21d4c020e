 One of the deceased's in-laws, Aloise Opuda, said Akinyi was killed as she was preparing supper.
 “She was killed in front of her step-children,” said Opuda.
 He said the suspect slashed his former wife with a machete.
 “The children raised the alarm when they saw their step-mother being attacked. We all rushed out to help her, but there was little we could do and she died due to excessive bleeding,” said Opuda.
 The suspect is said to have fled into a nearby bush after the incident.
 Homa Bay County Police Commander Marius Tum confirmed the incident, saying investigations had been launched.
