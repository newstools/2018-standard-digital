 The body was taken to the Kakamega County General Hospital mortuary.
 “I am appealing to drivers to drive carefully. Most of them do not observe traffic rules and end up causing accidents that could easily be avoided,” said Mr Kamurren.
 According to him, the truck’s brakes could have failed, making it difficult for the driver to control it.
 Waweru claimed that the truck driver was speeding.
 “I stopped and rushed to the scene but the driver was already dead,” he said.
