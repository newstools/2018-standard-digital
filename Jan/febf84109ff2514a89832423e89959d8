 In November last year, Governor Ferdinand Waititu announced plans to establish one major water company ‘to enhance efficiency in service delivery’. The governor said this would also enhance access to clean water by all residents.

 Yesterday, Wamwangi said: “I will not sit back and watch this administration take us back to the old way of doing things.
 “One of the primary objectives of devolution was to promote social and economic development and provision of quality services at the grassroots. Let’s not spoil the gains we have made by taking some of these drastic measures that will only cause harm,” he said.
 The Thika Water and Sewerage Company chairman, Joseph Mukora Kimani, urged the county government to consult the people and involve them before making certain decisions.
 The water and sewerage firms earmarked for dissolution are Kiambu, Kikuyu, Limuru, Githunguri, Gatundu, Karuri, and Ruiru-Juja. The governor said the companies were inefficient and accused them of failing to ensure that all residents had access to clean water.
