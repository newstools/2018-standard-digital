He added that even if the assembly had been in session, it could not have met on December 9 since it was a Saturday, which, is not a working day for MCAs. Written apology The MCAs said they wanted the AG and his office to formally withdraw the allegations against Mandera County and issue a written apology, failing which the county assembly would institute legal action. Speaking on behalf of the leaders, Khalif acknowledged the circulation of reports on social media, but said they did not respond to rumours. The leaders claimed the rumours on the 'people’s assembly' were being fuelled by parties working against the county. The AG on Monday went to the High Court seeking to invalidate 15 'people’s assemblies' and bar the establishment of others. In his report, AG Muigai listed Mandera among the 15 counties and named its county assembly as the fourth respondent in his case. ALSO READ:
