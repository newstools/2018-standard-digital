Nyali MP links Joho to tallying centre chaos “I find the application by the petitioner (Omar) to be based on his own feelings and opinions. He has not presented any facts that are substantial enough to compel the court to recuse itself,” said Achode. Omar had sought to remove Achode from the petition alleging bias against him but yesterday the judge accused the former Senator of propagating his feelings and opinions instead of fact and evidence. Omar accused Achode of bias and “double standards” and demanded her disqualification from the petition he has filed against governor Joho’s victory in the August 8 polls. In a certificate of urgency Omar had applied to have the file taken before Chief Justice Justice David Maraga to appoint another judge to proceed with the petition. Omar wants Joho’s victory in the gubernatorial poll overturned alleging monumental fraud on polling day. Last week Achode said after 30 years on the bench she cannot be bullied by lawyers.
