He maintained NASA had already made an application to use the venue and they will not change their plans of swearing in Raila. “The governor has been under pressure from the Jubilee Party to deny us a chance when he had made an application, but we will not change our plans,” said Magaya during an interview on KTN NEWS. In a notice that was published in the local dailies on Wednesday, January 24, the county said that the park is scheduled to undergo improvements in a bid to enhance its usefulness to the visitors that are always frequenting it.  “Notice is hereby given to the general public that Uhuru Park Grounds is scheduled to undergo phased improvement works in order to enhance usefulness to its visitors,” read part of the notice by acting County Secretary Leboo Ole Morintat. Magaya urged NASA supporters to turn out in large numbers for the much awaited event that will see Raila and Kalonzo Musyoka sworn in as President and deputy president of the People Assembly respectively. This is as a church and a group identifying Nairobi Business Community led by Gatundu South MP Moses Kuria had also applied to use Uhuru Park on January 30, the date for NASA’s swearing-in ceremony.
