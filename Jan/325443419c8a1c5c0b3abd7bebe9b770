Kindly obtain the leave application from the undersigned or the human resource and fill the same to enable us proceed with the approval process,” reads the letter signed by acting County Secretary Bibi Fondo. Yesterday, Mr Fondo said the letter is a normal procedure to prepare recipients psychologically for the completion of their contracts. “This is an internal issue and it is a normal procedure because we want to prepare these officers to have a break from work, rest and be free because their term is coming to an end. Human resource procedures say you take a terminal leave of 30 days and the rationale is that when your contract is coming to an end, you should not take up certain obligations or responsibilities,” said Fondo. He disputed claims the officers had been fired. Some reports indicate some of these officers had been short-listed for interviews in February. The letter sparked a frenzy on social media after an official, allegedly, circulated a text message asking these chief officers not to leave town because they may be needed any time. ALSO READ:
