 The Taveta sub-county public health officer, Jira Mwanyadi Dalu, said eight people had been confirmed to be suffering from diarrhoea and not cholera, as claimed by residents.
 “What I can confirm to you is that eight people, among them three primary school pupils, have been treated for diarrhoea at Mata location. Water samples have also been taken to Mombasa for further analysis,” said the official.

 County Commissioner Kula Hache advised residents with symptoms of the waterborne disease to visit the nearest health facility.
 “There is no cholera outbreak in the region. In case of diarrhoea, people should visit the nearest hospital for treatment,” said the commissioner.
 Public health officials said cases of diarrhoea in the area were common because of unsafe drinking water.

 “There is no running water in the affected area. Residents use stagnant water, which is not safe for human consumption, and this can be the main cause of the disease,” said Mr Dalu.
 He added that his department had been conducting public forums to sensitise residents on the need to boil drinking water to avert a cholera outbreak.
