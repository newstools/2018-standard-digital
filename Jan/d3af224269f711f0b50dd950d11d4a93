Narok North MP Moitalel ole Kenta clashed with Governor Samuel Tunai and some Jubilee MPs over today’s swearing-in of NASA leader Raila Odinga. During a church function at the weekend, the outspoken MP told faithful that NASA would swear in their ‘President’ since President Uhuru Kenyatta had rejected dialogue with Raila. “Justice and rights for all Kenyans should never be ignored. Since President Kenyatta refused to sit and talk with Raila, we are going to swear him on January 30. I know they will be looking for us the following day begging for talks but it will be too late,” said Mr Kenta. ALSO READ:

NASA vows to go ahead with 'swearing-in' But Jubilee leaders dismissed the planned swearing-in, saying the President already has the instruments of power. Governor Tunai, MPs Korei Lemein (Narok South), Lemanken Aramat (Narok East), Gabriel Tongoyo (Narok West) said there was no vacuum in the presidency. “As someone with considerable experience in public service, I can tell you for free that there is nothing like swearing-in. We have the President, his deputy and the Cabinet is now in place... Those dreaming of swearing in should forget it,” said Tunai. His sentiments were echoed by other leaders who asked Kenta to stop misleading the public. “Those claiming that there will be a similar ceremony on Tuesday are day dreaming,” said Mr Aramat.
