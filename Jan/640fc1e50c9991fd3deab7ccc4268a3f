Travellers using the Mai Mahiu-Limuru road were stranded for three hours due to a major traffic snarl-up.
 The jam that stretched for over 20km was caused by an accident, involving a trailer, near the Italian Catholic Church, ten kilometres from Mai Mahiu Town.

 A motorist, James Wambugu, said the driver lost control of the trailer before it landed on its side.
 "Other drivers did not make things any better by overlapping on the narrow road, leading to a massive traffic jam.

 This came barely a day after another accident along the same road forced motorists to use alternative routes. In the latest incident, the Nakuru-bound trailer closed part of the road.
 "The trailer blocked part of the already narrow road. This led to massive traffic jam that lasted over three hours," said Wambugu. 
 Senior police officer, who did not wish to be named, said frequent jams on the road were worrying.
 “We are recording major traffic jams on this road at least twice every week. It would do everybody a lot of good if the road can be expanded," said the officer.
 Meanwhile, 20 traders were arrested by public health officials in a swoop to stop food hawking in Naivasha Town.
 The suspects were arrested after they were found hawking food near the main bus terminus. They had ignored a government directive to stop selling food in the open.
