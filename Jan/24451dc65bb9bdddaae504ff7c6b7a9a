Arguably the biggest in western Kenya, the mall has been projected to raise about Sh230 million annually as tenants rush to occupy it. With over 30 per cent of its premises already leased out, the mall is set to transform the economy of the region. When The Standard visited the mall yesterday, there was a beehive of activity as tenants refurbished their shops in readiness for the grand opening. Measuring about 60,000 square feet, the five-floor mega investment has about 140 shops, a three-star hotel, showrooms, and a parking area that can accommodate 335 cars. Evans Atera, the acting managing director of the Lake Basin Development Authority, said his organisation was working on the final plans to open the mall. Dr Atera noted that several tenants had expressed an interest in the mall, whose construction has already seen a lot of development in nearby Mamboleo and its environs. The Communications Authority, Bata Shoe Company, and Best Western are among the tenants who have already booked space at the mall. ALSO READ:
