It comes at a time when Treasury is trying to cut down spending after warning that recurrent expenditure demands could affect the economy. “Recurrent expenditure is a risk and we are having pressures on the wage bill from unions and if you allow me Chairman Budget from parliament,” Treasury PS Dr Kamau Thugge said during the presentation of the 2018 draft budget. He made the remarks after MPs overturned SRC cap on mileage which would pave way for the 416 MPs to pocket Sh668,000 extra in allowances and salary at the end of this month. According to the 2018 Budget Policy Statement by the Treasury, the public sector wage bill has increased by nearly Sh100 billion over the last three years despite the Government’s efforts to tame recurrent expenditure. Treasury predicts the wage bill, which stood at Sh307 billion in 2015 and has since risen to Sh401 billion, will hit Sh444 billion next year. Treasury data shows Kenya will pay Sh304 billion as interest on loans and Sh76 billion as pensions next year leaving less for development.
