He claimed that he has reports that some politicians and business people are funding youths to terrorize people. He, however, did not provide proof to the claims. But a senior officer who talked to the Standard said the move by Sonko was a knee-jerk reaction, which cannot help. “He knows where the problem is. Hawkers and street children are the problem and the governor must address that first,” said the officer who asked not to be named. The County Government has allowed hawkers to operate on some city streets, which, police say is contributing to the rise of crime. Tens of street children are also roaming the city streets and some of them have been blamed for crime incidents reported so far. There has been an upsurge of mugging and snatching incidents in the city. Muggers walk in groups of between five and ten people attacking pedestrians. ALSO READ:
