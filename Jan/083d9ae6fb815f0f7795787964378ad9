Nyeri Governor Mutahi Kahiga yesterday confirmed that the county had set aside Sh50 million to renovate the county government offices in Nyeri town.
 “We want to ensure that all county executives and chief officers are under one roof at the governor’s offices so they are accessible to the public,” said Kahiga.

 Currently, county executives are spread across the town in offices that housed national government departments before devolution.
 “It's important that county departments work and relate well as a team,” the governor said when he hosted journalists for a breakfast meeting.

 In the previous administration under the late Governor Nderitu Gachagua, a similar initiative was undertaken with the renovation of Karson House.
 The move caused controversy as Sh40 million was spent in 2013 to renovate two floors.
