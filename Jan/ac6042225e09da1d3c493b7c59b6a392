This will be the envoy's second attempt to have the Kenyans freed. His first effort flopped when the abductors remained adamant about a Sh20 million ransom. The two pilots were captured by Sudan People’s Liberation Army-In Opposition (SPLA-IO) rebels when their plane crashed following to a technical hitch. A woman and 11 cows died in the accident. The pilots and nine passengers suffered minor injuries.
