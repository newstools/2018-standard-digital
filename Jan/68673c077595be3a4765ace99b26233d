Police are investigating the death of a 54-year-old man whose body was found in his house in Kayole.
 The body was rotting at the time it was discovered on New Year by neighbours who said they were alerted by a foul smell emanating from the house.

 Kayole OCPD Joseph Gichangi said the man lived alone and it was not clear what caused the death.
 “The body had decomposed by the time it was discovered and it seems to be a sudden death or murder. We are investigating,” he said.

 Gichangi said they hoped a postmortem would reveal what caused the death. The body was moved to the mortuary as authorities started investigations into the incident.
 This was after police broke into the house to remove it. The man had not been seen since Saturday.
 In Mukuru slums, two other men were found dead in their houses in separate incidents. The bodies were moved to the mortuary.
 One was found with blood oozing from his mouth and police suspect murder. Investigations are ongoing.
