Nine senior county officials whose positions were advertised will know their fate next week.
 Governor John Nyagarama had fired the eight chief officers and County Secretary Eric Onchana before the court reversed his decision.
 This was after a resident, Vincent Omao, moved to court seeking orders to stop the governor's action. Omao argued that sacking them was unlawful as their terms had not expired.
  A judge ordered an out-of-court settlement. But efforts by Nyagarama and his deputy Amos Nyaribo to reach a deal over termination of the officials' contracts hit a snag after the talks collapsed.

 Nyagarama ordered them to go home until Monday when they would know their fate.
 The officials have been drawing salaries and allowances for four months without working. Part of the deal was that the officers serve until November this year.
 Nyagarama offered to pay them for the remainder of the time if they resigned but they refused.
 "We will not sack ourselves. If the governor does not want us, let him sack us then he will pay us per the law," said one of the officers.
