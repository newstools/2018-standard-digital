Speaking at a Kerugoya hotel during a two day safety workshop for Kukena Sacco drivers, the NTSA was urged to revise the fee downwards. According to the NTSA’s Mt Kenya Regional Manager Mr Cyprian Michieka, the new license will contain details of individual driver including his biometric data which will be making it possible and easier to tame rouge drivers. Michieka said the document will be able to electronically capture and store records of over speeding drivers as well as other related traffic offences. “The license has 100 points mark which will reduce downwards according to the number of traffic offences a holder of such a license commits and on getting to the 40 mark,   the document will be cancelled by the issuing authority,”Michieka said. Michieka said once a license has been cancelled, the concerned driver will remain banned   for a period of three years after which he will be required to go back to a driving school. ALSO READ:
