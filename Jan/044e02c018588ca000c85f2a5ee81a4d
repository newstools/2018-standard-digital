 Just a day after the National Super Alliance (NASA) made public its road-map to the inauguration of Raila Odinga and Kalonzo Musyoka as the peoples’ President and Deputy President on January 30, the government has vowed to act decisively on the assemblies.

 “The government is going to get so rough with those people. Let them watch this space. There will be no dialogue. Those are their own hallucinations and we will clamp down on the assemblies because they are illegal,” said Mr Murathe.
 “The Constitution allows the people to express themselves directly or through their leaders. So if their leaders form a peoples’ assembly, it means the people are representing themselves directly,” he said.
 Murathe warned that the President will not tolerate activities aimed at making the country ungovernable.
