The woman's mother, Alice Kamathi, told of her shock and pain on receiving news of the death of her second child, adding that they had communicated two days ago. Speaking at her Kayole estate home in Naivasha, Nakuru County, Ms Kamathi said Waithera, who was also a nurse, supported the family financially and also sent medication. “My first born and I are diabetic, and since my husband died seven years ago, we have relied on my daughter, who has been living in Germany for the last eight years,” she said, while calling on the Government to intervene so they could get justice. Waithera's brother Samuel Njuguna said he had communicated with the Kenyan embassy in Germany but was referred to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Nairobi. According to him, reports received from friends in Germany indicated that his sister was stabbed by an unknown man who then fled. “This is a very painful time for our family and we hope the person behind this beastly incident is arrested and arraigned in court,” said Mr Njuguna.
