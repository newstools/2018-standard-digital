 Economic pundits see this as yet another step by the Paul Kagame leadership to get the country’s economic take off from her current 8 per cent growth rate of GDP to 10 per cent.
 Rwandan growth rate is the highest in the region, with Kenya’s having registered a slump in its growth to a five-year low of 4.4 per cent.
 The decision was arrived at early November by the Directorate General of Immigration that had resolved to issue a 30-day visa to all nationals across the world.
 In addition, foreigners will use Resident ID Cards for entry into the country, including the use of electronic gates (Automated Passenger Clearance System) at Kigali International Airport.
