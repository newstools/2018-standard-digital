 Bring expertise
 Speaking during the launch, Cytonn Managing Partner and Chief Executive Edwin Dande said they seek to bring development expertise closer to the target market and also develop relationships.
 “We spent the first phase of our growth focusing on Nairobi Metropolitan area, where we now have over Sh82 billion of real estate projects. Our clients, especially the institutional clients, are now demanding diversification both locally and into other African markets,” he said.
 The firm plans to launch into Coast, Western and North Rift regions before the end of the year.
 “In sub-Saharan Africa we are looking into Uganda, Tanzania and Rwanda in the East Africa, and Ghana and Nigeria in West Africa. We already have strong partners in all markets and an active deal on the pipeline,” said Mr Dande. 
 Nyeri Governor Mutahi Kahiga, accompanied by other senior county government officials, officiated the opening.
