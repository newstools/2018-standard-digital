 According to Buruburu OCPD Geoffrey Mayiek, the officers ordered the two suspects to surrender and on being searched they were found with a certificate of appointment, a fake pistol and a pair of handcuffs.
 The officer's accomplice is said to be a casual labourer in the area. The two were later taken to the local police station where they were locked up.

 They will be arraigned in court soon to  face robbery with violence charges.
 This is the latest incident in which police are accused of involvement in crime.
 At the weekend, a police officer and three civilians were arrested in a botched carjacking incident on a matatu along Thika Road.
 The matatu was ferrying passengers from Thika to Nairobi when it was blocked by a salon car in Ndarugo on Saturday night. Police recovered a Ceska pistol with 15 bullets recovered.
