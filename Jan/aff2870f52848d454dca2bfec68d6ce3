NAIROBI, KENYA: Youth Enterprise Development Fund Chairman Ronald Osumba last week was hard pressed to counter allegations that the Uwezo Fund was sluggish in processing disbursements. Several young people had taken to the Fund’s social media pages complaining that loan applications were taking several months instead of the weeks prescribed by the agency. ALSO READ:

Budget estimates for the 2015/2016 financial year indicate that the Youth Development Fund received Sh650 million in capital grants down from Sh200 million the agency had requested. This translates to roughly Sh54 million each month in money available for disbursement. In the 2016/2017 financial year, the figures from budget estimates indicate that allocations to the Youth Fund from Treasury went further down to Sh500 million translating to an average of Sh41 million per month in available disbursements. This is much higher than the Sh20 million Osumba had claimed was being disbursed each month by June 2016 when he joined the fund. In the current financial year, the youth fund saw a bump in capital grants receiving Sh800 million from the national Treasury for youth loan disbursements. ALSO READ:

The fund has projected allocations for youth loans at Sh850 million and Sh900 million for the 2018/2019 and 2019/2020 financial years respectively.
