 They now await vetting and approval by Parliament before being confirmed.
 The trio will be joining CS’s Fred Matiang’i (Interior), Charles Keter (Energy), Najib Balala (Tourism), Henry Rotich (Treasury), Joe Mucheru (ICT) and James Macharia (Transport), who have been reassured of another term.
 President Kenyatta also announced that he has already received and accepted the resignation of Mr Tobiko as the DPP, a position he has held since 2005.
 Uhuru’s move to appoint Yatani and Munyes to the Cabinet did not come as a surprise, as some of the technocrats he appointed as CS’s during his first term were accused of being unable to sell the Jubilee manifesto.
 President Kenyatta and his Deputy William Ruto had before constituting their first team in 2013 declared that they wanted a Cabinet of technocrats, promising that if it would only have two politicians.
