Kenyan Premier League sides Gor Mahia and AFC Leopards have threatened to pull out of Confederations of African Football competitions after their major sponsor SportPesa cancelled their sponsorship. At the same time, Kenya Rugby Union (KRU) boss Richard Omwela was quoted as saying rugby would be dead after the departure of the betting company.
 While we know that it will be a tall order for Gor Mahia and AFC Leopards to honour continental matches without a sponsor, it brings us to the question of why sports clubs or federations rely on one sponsor.

 Does it mean the national rugby team will not honour the remaining World Rugby Series legs just because their main sponsor has pulled out? It is unfortunate that clubs and federations have opted for the comfort zone instead of widening their sources of money.
 At this time and age, Gor and AFC should not be threatening to pull out of continental competitions due to financial challenges. Kenyan rugby is also a big brand that should attract big money.

 We therefore urge the organisations to stop crying over spilled milk and seriously look for other sponsors. All clubs and federations should move with speed and ensure they have money to support their activities. This will only happen once they get more than one sponsor and ensure the contracts are water-tight.
