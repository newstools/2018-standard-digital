Laikipia set aside Sh140m for road repairs Speaking when he commissioned the project in Umande ward yesterday, Mr Mwaniki said the repairs would enable farmers, commuters and motorists to use the roads without difficulty during the expected rains in February and March. “We are prioritising the roads that are dilapidated. The ward representatives are helping us to identify the roads,” said the deputy governor. He said the works, which include grading, gravelling and culvert installation, will take eight weeks to complete. Umande resident Joseph Theuri said the repairs would ease travel. “It will be easy to rush patients to hospital in an emergency. And children will be safe going to school," he said. “Transporting farm harvests to the market will now be easy,” said Joyce Wangui, a trader in Umande. The project was launched a week after the county began a Sh13.6 million rehabilitation of the Nyahururu bus terminus.
