 According to a notice by the Kenya Revenue Authority (KRA), the auction is meant to clear abandoned goods from Customs' facilities.

 The notice did not reveal the value of the goods to be sold.
 “Interested buyers are encouraged to view the goods at Customs Warehouse and in respective release stations on the dates published in the gazette notices,” said the notice.
 Joseph Kaguru, chief manager for Port Operations at KRA, said hundreds of vehicles and assorted items would be up for sale.
 He said uncollected goods scattered in all custom-bonded warehouses across the country would be sold off after the expiry of the 30-day deadline by KRA.
 Items to be auctioned were on display yesterday at the Custom Warehouse within the port and designated container freight stations within Mombasa.
 They included cars, building materials, books, bicycles, clothes, bags of citric acid and drums containing bitumen used in road construction.
