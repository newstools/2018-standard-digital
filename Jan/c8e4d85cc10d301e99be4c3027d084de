KIMILILI, KENYA: Kimilili MP Didmus Barasa has kicked off an ambitious housing project that will see all poor households with grass-thatched buildings in the constituency benefit.
 At its initial stages, the project will see all the grass-thatched houses brought down and replaced by new, iron sheets-roofed houses.

 “This was part of my pledge when I asked the Kimilili people for their votes. I am determined to make it a reality,” he said in an interview when he launched the programme in Maeni, Kibingei, Maeni and Kimilili Wards.
 “We have so far brought down 18 grass-thatched houses and replaced them with better quality iron sheets-roofed houses. Hopefully before the new year, we would have done more than 100 houses, translating to about 1,000 beneficiaries,” said the Jubilee Party legislator.

 Emily Naliaka, a mother of five, from Maeni Ward was one of the beneficiaries of the project. She lauded the move, saying it had given her children hope in life. “We used to suffer a lot during rainy seasons because of the leakages. It was also insecure to stay in this house because thugs would easily break in. Now, with this new house, I am relieved,” said the grinning Mrs Naliaka.
 Besides the overhaul of the low-quality houses, Mr Barasa says he is also in the process of kicking poverty out of Kimilili by attracting the residents to wealth-creating economic activities.
