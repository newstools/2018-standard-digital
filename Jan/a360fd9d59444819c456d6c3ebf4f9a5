Kessom Assistant Chief Edwin Kemboi said the victim was shot by a neighbour after a disagreement. “The suspect turned himself in at Kapyego AP Camp after committing the offence. The police are still interrogating him to find out what happened between him and the victim,” said Mr Kemboi. He said angry villagers burnt four houses belonging to the suspect’s relatives on Monday night and launched more attacks the next day, razing 20 others. "We tried to plead with the youths to abandon their mission but they wouldn't listen. They were furious and wanted to lynch the suspect. No one would stand in their way," said the chief. Marakwet West OCPD Apollo Onyonyi said more police officers had been sent to the area to restore order. He said those involved in the destruction of property would be arrested and charged.
