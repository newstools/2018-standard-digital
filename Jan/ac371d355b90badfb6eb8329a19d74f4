Kahawa Wendani residents protested on Sunday when Kiambu Governor Ferdinand Waititu stormed the area and demolished a kiosk near a public toilet.
 According to the residents, Mr Waititu’s team intended to destroy the toilet located near the Kahawa Wendani bus stage.

 The team cleared a section of the road to make way for a new stage, which the governor wants moved from near Magunas Supermarket.
 A group of youths burnt tyres and blocked the road, claiming the governor was trying to sabotage their sources of income.

 Lewis Luchetu, the chairman of transport operators at the Kahawa Wendani stage and an official of the Kahawa All Stars football team, condemned the governor’s actions.
 “The toilet and stage provide a livelihood for youths. They also fund the Kahawa All Stars team. The governor does not have the authority to destroy the toilet,” said Mr Luchetu.
 Some residents and traders described the action as malice against Kahawa Wendani MCA Cyrus Omondi, who had installed electricity and piped water in the public toilet. But sources close to Waititu denied claims that the move targeted certain individuals.
