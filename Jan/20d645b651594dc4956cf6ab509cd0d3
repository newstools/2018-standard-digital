 According to County Assembly Speaker George Okode, the governor has submitted a new list but it had missing information.
 “We have requested the governor to provide us with that information to proceed. The approval law requires that when submitting a list of Cabinet nominees, you provide information regarding the suitability of those candidates, lack of which the list is considered not duly submitted,” said the speaker.

 In letter written by the speaker and addressed to the county secretary, the assembly is seeking information on evidence of knowledge and relevant experience and distinguished career of not less than five years in the portfolios to which they have been nominated.
 The assembly is further seeking documentary evidence of virtues and experiences espoused to enable them fast-track and conclude the overdue vetting.
 “We will only act on the list when all the requirements accompany the notification for the list,” said the Speaker.
 But yesterday, Rasanga denied claims that he was yet to supply the assembly with all the necessary information.
 “I gave everything they wanted and I am not aware of anything that I have not given. As far as I am concerned, there is nothing left from my part,” noted Rasanga.
