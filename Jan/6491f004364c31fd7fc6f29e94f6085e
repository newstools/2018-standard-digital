 Tension is rising in Hola town and neighbouring villages following the discovery of 19 dead cattle on Saturday. The dead animals were found on a farm in Kone village, Galole, Tana River County. Over the years, conflicts over land between pastoralist and farming communities have sparked bloody conflict in Tana River. In past incidents, farmers have accused pastoralists of driving their herds into their farms. Grazing areas Pastoralists on the other hand accuse farming communities of blocking them from grazing areas. Yesterday, police warned both sides against drawing conclusions about who was to blame for the animal's deaths, saying tissue samples had been sent to the Government chemist for tests, following rumours the animals may have been poisoned. Tana River OCPD Silvester Githungo called for calm, warning both sides that speculation might fan animosity. "Police will not arrest someone on the basis of speculation," he said. Local leaders also called for calm, appealing to residents to allow police to complete investigations. Chewani MCA Sauda Lodah appealed to both communities to be patient with police investigations. Elsewhere, tension is high at Lomirok area of Baragoi in Samburu North sub-county after a man was shot and injured in a failed cattle raid. Lothur Ekitara was in a group of four herders who were ambushed by a group of armed rustlers on Saturday evening. However, the four fought off the raiders who fled after a fierce gun battle that left Ekitara wounded. He is admitted at Samburu County referral hospital. The incident has left villagers in fear of a retaliatory attack. Samburu North OCPD Alphonse Munga said he was not aware of the incident.
