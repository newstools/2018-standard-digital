A bright needy student risks losing his chance at Alliance High School after his parents failed to raise the fees.
 Gideon Bett, 16, from Transmara East in Narok County scored 388 marks in last year's KCPE examinations after he repeated because of lack of funds to join Form One. He scored 288 in the 2016 KCPE examination.
 “I did my first KCPE in 2016 at Kimerumeru Primary and got 288 marks. I was admitted to secondary school but my parents could not raise fees. I opted to repeat after well-wishers offered to pay fees at Goodwill Academy where I got 388 marks but my parents are unable again to raise the fees to enable me join Alliance,” said Gideon.
 The boy, who aspires to be a doctor, is contemplating repeating Standard Eight again should he fail to get support. “I want to get an A in my dream high school - Alliance - then pursue medicine so that I can eradicate poverty in our family. I am appealing to well-wishers to assist me,” said Gideon.

 His parents, Richard and Valentine Bett, who are farmhands said the boy tried in vain to get a scholarship from Equity’s Wings to Fly and Jomo Kenyatta Foundation. Form One fees is Sh53,554.
