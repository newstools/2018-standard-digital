A number of schools around the city stayed closed due to fears of chaos during the Opposition’s swearing-in ceremony yesterday. Parents of pupils at Jonathan Gloag Academy received text messages saying there would be no school to ensure the safety of children and members of staff and to avoid any eventualities that might arise due to the event.

A security officer at the premises said the school felt the children would be safer with their parents. However, it was business as usual at Moi Avenue Primary School, where learning went on as usual and some classes even had parent-teacher meetings. The head teacher said they were safe and had nothing to fear. “We had already planned for the meeting last week and there was no way we were going to postpone it,” said the head teacher. “We are safe here. Once we close the gate, we are okay. The only problem would be if the police fire teargas outside,” she said.
