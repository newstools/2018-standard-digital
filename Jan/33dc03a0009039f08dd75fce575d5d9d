 Through lawyer Kipkoech Ng’etich, the board and parents named Education Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang’i, Nakuru County Education Director Nyang’au Atebe and the Attorney General as respondents.
 “We are also asking Dr Matiang’i and the County Director of Education to be restrained from interfering, dealing and/or oppressing operations of the school,” Mr Ng'etich told The Standard yesterday.

 He said they also wanted the court to prevent the CS from attempting to disband the management board.
 Ng'etich said the future of the 318 students was at stake and the matter should be heard expeditiously.
