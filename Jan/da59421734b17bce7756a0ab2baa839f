Railaâ€™s swearing-in has been cancelled, claims MP Ikolomani MP Bernard Shinali (Jubilee) asked Mudavadi to be at the forefront of ensuring all leaders from the region stay united. "Mudavadi should act now and convene the meeting. We will attend even if we are in Jubilee Party because we want to speak with one voice on everything," said Mr Shinali. He noted that Jubilee and NASA had shortchanged the community and that it was time for them to work together for the sake of the community. Lugari MP Ayub Savula (ANC) welcomed calls for having the meeting convened, but urged Jubilee MPs to join NASA. "They should come we work together.
