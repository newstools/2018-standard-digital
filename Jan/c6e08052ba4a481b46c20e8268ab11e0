Over 200 students at the Kings Medical College in Nyeri were left to grapple with the fact that the money they had spent on their education was all for nothing. The students who had pinned their hopes in their education were shocked after they realized that the school was offering a course in medical laboratory that was not accredited by the relevant body. As they watched their Director Lucy Njue, Lecturer Lamuel Mureithi and others arrested by police for defying court orders they could not fully understand what the issue was. The College owner, Embu Level 5 Chief Executive and Former Chief Government pathologist Moses Njue were later detained by police at the Naro Moru police station. The school had been issued a closure notice last year for failure to register with the Kenya Medical Laboratory Technicians and Technologists Board (KMLTTB). According to the KMLTTB chief executive Patrick Kisabey the school had registered students who did not meet the required qualifications. “They moved to court late last year and as you can see the ruling by Judge Teresia Matheka dated January 18, 2018 disallowed an application by the institution to block the board from closing it,” he said. Medical Laboratory students who constitute 80 per cent of the school population left the school premises after police were called in to aid in the closure of the college. While reading the closure notice pinned at the gate stating that “Notice is hereby given that an immediate closure (cessation of operation) is in effect on the medical laboratory issued with this notice” the irate students engaged police in running battles after the matter got out of hand. Others who were puzzled about how to pick up the pieces were left crying after seeing the closure notice. “I really do not understand what is going on, I pay Sh 52,000 per semester yet the school is supposed to be shut,” said one student.
