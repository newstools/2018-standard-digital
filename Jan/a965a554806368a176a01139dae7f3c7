Hundreds of mourners on Friday attended the burial of veteran journalist David Njuguna Mutonya, 57, who was eulogised as a liberation hero, human rights defender and anti-corruption crusader.
 Friends, relatives and colleagues described the former Nation Media Group Mombasa bureau chief as a firm but friendly man who mentored journalists and promoted theatre.

 Tourism Cabinet Secretary Najib Balala said Mutonya shaped his political career after advising him in 1997 to seek the support of Mombasa tycoons and power brokers in his bid for Mombasa mayoral seat.
 “He is the one who introduced me to politics. He advised me to get hold of tycoons and political figures with power to decide who becomes the next mayor after Ahmed Mwidani retires. When I was given the nod, Mutonya told me not to waste the opportunity and I became mayor,” he told mourners at the requiem mass at the Holy Ghost Catholic Cathedral.
