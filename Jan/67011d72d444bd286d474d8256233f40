 “We are satisfied with the report. Ben was hit on the back with a heavy object. Our son was murdered,” said Mr Nyamu, adding that the family would not relent in their quest for justice.
 But Peter Kinyanjui, the director of Lake Nakuru Flamingo Lodge where Kuria died, maintained the counsellor drowned.
 He termed the reports of assault rumours aimed at tarnishing his hotel's reputation.
 “He drowned and claims he was hit are rumours. No fights were reported that day,” he said.
