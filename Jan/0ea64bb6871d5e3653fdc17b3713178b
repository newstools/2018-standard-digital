 “Uhuru should swallow his pride and meet Raila. Our country is bigger than the two. We need a dialogue similar to what happened following the 2007/2008 post-election violence that threatened to tear our country apart,” said Kenta, who chairs the Implementation Committee.
 "We do not want the peace we have been enjoying to be interrupted. Whenever there is a crisis, it is the vulnerable, women and children, who suffer. We don't want this to happen," the MP said yesterday.

 Kenta, who spoke during election of elPurko Development Trust officials, maintained the Maasai would only support leaders who have the community's best interests at heart.
 The function brought together elected leaders in the county from across the political divide. The politicians promised to work together to develop the region.
 Other leaders who attended the function were Narok South MP Korei Lemein of Jubilee, his Norok West counterpart Gabriel Tongoyo of Chama Cha Mashinani and Woman Representative Soipan Tuya of Jubilee.
 Several MCAs were also present.
 "We have realised we need to unite and serve our people who elected us without minding a lot about our political parties. We need a common stand on matters affecting the county," said Soipan.
