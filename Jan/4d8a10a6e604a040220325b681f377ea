Iconic for his British-made pinstriped bespoke suits, a rose in his lapel and a watch on the chain, ‘Sir’ Charles Njonjo has literally dressed to the nines. Njonjo who has been christened ‘Duke of Kabetshire’ has turned 98 years old. The former powerful Attorney General and Constitutional affairs Minister in the post-colonial government left public service in 1983 amidst allegations of trying to overthrow President Moi. Charles Njonjo bowed to a ‘traitor’ onslaught from a section of Kenyan legislators resigning as the Attorney general before a judicial commission was set to investigate his conduct. At the inquiry, Njonjo was accused of abusing his office, illegally sneaking into the country an assortment of weapons and communication gear that could jam communication at State House, planning a military coup among other allegations. The commission would find him guilty only to be pardoned by President Moi. Now at 98, the former legislator has remained regal, enigmatic and has been touted as one of the richest men in Kenya. Those close to him say the conservation lover, still swims, with some say he can ride a bicycle. Standard Digital posted on Facebook, asking for the messages Kenyans had for Sir Njongo and predictably it set off a cascade of praise. Johnson Sang wrote, “Happy birthday mzee, I remember your firm resolve to protect the constitution in 1970s, May God the Almighty grand you abundant peace.”  ‘’ God bless you Sir Charles. God gives you another decade. It's the good you did to society,” Moses Nkuya posted.  Mutua James would however want to know the secret to living long, “Happy birthday Mzee..tupe siri, 98yrs and at 30 ni uzee tupu,” he asked.  “A good daddy to us and now babu,just wishing you a peaceful life and good health,” Susan Anyolo wrote.
