 Mr Mbugua takes over the reins at a time when REA is shifting strategy in procure materials exclusively from local manufacturers and assemblers.
 “The board has resolved that tenders for supply of transformers, cables and other materials used in the construction of electricity lines will be given to local manufacturers only,” Mr Gicharu said.
 REA has been issuing mixed tenders with most of the equipment procured from Chinese and Indian manufacturers.
 Mr Gicharu urged local suppliers to take advantage of the move but warned that the REA would blacklist firms that supply substandard materials.
 The Authority which has a Sh14 billion power plant with a capacity to generate 55 megawatts says it plans to spend Sh700 million to install seven diesel–powered generators (Gensets) in off-grid areas, thereby enabling more Kenyans in far-flung regions to access electricity.
