Adequately monitored But Meru Deputy Governor Titus Ntuchiu, while insisting that there was no cholera in the region, said the situation in areas cited by Isiolo was adequately monitored and that there was sufficient capacity in the region to deal with any cases that may arise. Mr Ntuchiu said Isiolo should not complain about handling patients from Meru because the measure was reciprocal. “We are saying our counterparts in Isiolo have delved into an unfortunate area because patients do not have boundaries. Meru facilities are presently taking care of people from Marsabit, Samburu and Isiolo with no qualms, but our principal treatment centre remains Mwerokanga Dispensary in Tigania West,” said Ntuchiu He said specialised treatment for suspected cases of cholera was available at the Meru Teaching and Referral Hospital.
