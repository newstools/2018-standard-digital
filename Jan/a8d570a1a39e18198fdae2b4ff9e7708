Phase one of the Standard Gauge Railway connecting Mombasa and Nairobi is already operational, having come into service on June 1, 2017. The new service has revolutionised travel between the two cities. Passenger trains operating between the two points have not only reduced the cost, but have also cut down the time it takes to travel from Mombasa to Nairobi and vice versa to only four hours. Equally important, the first SGR cargo delivery to Nairobi from Mombasa was made early this month, signalling the seriousness that the Government attaches to its flagship project that, upon completion, will have immense value for Kenyans and the economy; creating jobs, reducing congestion and delays at the port of Mombasa, easing passenger and freight transportation as well as lowering cost. However, challenges still abound, and mostly revolve around the acquisition of land along the projected route. Indeed, some rights group went to court seeking to stop the construction of the railway line citing environmental concerns and the possible negative effects of SGR on wildlife as its route runs through the Maasai Mara.

Raila vows to push on with swearing-in plan Concerns have been raised by the Government over the high cost of land between Nairobi and Naivasha that could cost the government Sh15 billion, which Kenya Railways Managing Director Atanas Maina said was unsustainable. Despite these challenges, the Government has announced SGR construction to Olkaria will continue. Completion time is expected to be 36 months. Outstanding matters of land acquisition need to be cleared amicably in order that people who have to be relocated get adequate compensation in good time to enable them settle elsewhere with ease.
