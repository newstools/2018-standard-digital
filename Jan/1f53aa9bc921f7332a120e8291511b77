 "The Supermarket had accumulated unpaid rent ofSh36 Million prompting the owner of the mall to evict the retailer," said the employee.
 He said over 52 workers had resigned  in past few months due to nonpayment of salaries while only 42 were in the payroll by the time of closure.
 According to the employee, the proprietor intends to rent the Mall to a Choppies Supermarket from South Africa which has other few branches in the country.
 The eviction came two months after the supermarket closed down when the owner of the mall hired welders to permanently close the doors owing to rent arrears.
 However the store's management put a notice indicating that the closure was temporary and business operations at the shop would resume soon.
 Even after the closure some employers were still reporting to work arguing that the business was closed by the landlord and not their employer.
