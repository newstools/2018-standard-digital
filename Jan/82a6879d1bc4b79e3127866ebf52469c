The warder said on the material day, KWS got information from the public that an elephant had been killed in the area, prompting eight officers to respond. He said upon reaching the scene, the warders found the carcass of an elephant with both tusks chopped off. The suspects were later traced to manyatta where the warders recovered the two elephant tusks, 10 arrows, two spears, three bows and two swords believed to have been used by the two for poaching. In her judgement, Ms Juma said the prosecution evidence was consistent and that the two were found in possession of the tasks. She said the two are free to appeal in 14 days.
