President Kenyatta Friday made sweeping changes affecting top officials working at State house.
 Whereas the Head of State retained Joseph Kinyua as Head of Public Service, the chief of staff component previously held by him was transferred to Nzioka Waita who will now serve as Chief of Staff and Head of Presidential Delivery Unit.
 The President similarly appointed former Nakuru Governor Kinuthia Mbugua as State House Comptroller, replacing Lawrence Lenayapa who will now serve as Kenya’s Ambassador to the Netherlands.
 This is not the first time for Mr Mbugua to occupy the inner sanctum of State house.

 In 2012, he resigned as Administration Police Commandant after rising through the ranks in the service since 1981.
 Mr Lenayapa, who has served in the Kenyatta administration since his appointment in 2013, kept a low profile unlike his predecessors under the Kibaki administration.
 The President also appointed new Cabinet Secretaries who include Director of Public Prosecution Keriako Tobiko, former Marsabit Governor Ukur Yattani and former Turkana Senator John Munyes.
 Promoted
 Rift Valley Regional Co-ordinator Wanyama Musiambo has been promoted to deputy Head of Public Service. Mr Musimabo is believed to have had good working relations with those in high state echelons.
 The fate of State House spokesperson Manoah Esipisu, however, was unclear as the President did not say whether he would be retained or not.
 The President retained Cabinet Secretaries Fred Matiang’i (Interior), Charles Keter (Energy), Najib Balala (Tourism), Henry Rotich (Treasury), Joe Mucheru (ICT) and James Macharia (Transport).
