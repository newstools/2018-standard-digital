Fire destroys property worth Sh3.5m in Voi, Taita Taveta Presiding High Court judge Justice Erick Ogola struck out the petition, saying the matter can be competently handled by Milimani Law Courts in Nairobi, which is handling a similar case. Early last year, the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission (EACC) launched a criminal probe leading to the prosecution of the governor at the Milimani court. This came after Kenyatta University swore an affidavit that a certificate showing that Mr Samboja graduated at the institution was a forgery. Samboja had challenged the petition, saying the electoral court should not go into the issue of his degree certificate because it was already before another court. The High Court concurred. “Milimani High Court is better placed to investigate the matter to its logical conclusion. It will be an exercise in futility if I continue with the case in the High Court in Voi. The Nairobi-based High Court is better placed to find out if the governor is not qualified to hold the position,” ruled the judge. Justice Ogola defended his decision to dismiss the petition. “The Milimani court which is handling a similar petition number 382 of 2017 has enough resources and personnel to investigate and handle the matter. It would be prejudicial if the two courts give two contradictory rulings,” said Justice Ogolla. ALSO READ:
