DPP to open inquiry on crashed plane Hundreds of friends and family turned up for the burial of the 25-year-old First Officer Jeane Mureithi in her ancestral home in Giakanja.  Her parents donned pilot uniforms in honor of their fallen daughter. A second born and only girl in a family of three children, her mother, Jane Mureithi, described her as devoted, obedient and hardworking woman who was determined to be the best. “I shall greatly miss your captivating smile, your company in many ways. I have accepted God's perfect will and I believe He will guide me in life without you,” she said. Her eulogy painted a glimpse of the first officer’s short but successful life after defying odds to attain a flying licence at 24 years of age.  After her sitting her KCSE, she was admitted at Strathmore University and four years later graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Business and Finance but she wanted more. In 2015, She enrolled at the Kenya School of Flying and in 2017 she attained her Private and Commercial flying license.
