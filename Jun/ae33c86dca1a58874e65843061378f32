The prosecution informed the court that Ms Eddlied will not only interfere with the witnesses but also, with the co-accused persons who want to confess over the killing. “From the confession, it’s clear the first accused exercises dominion and control over the rest of the accused and would not stop at anything to eliminate not only witnesses but the accused too,” said Muteti.
