The Central Bank of Kenya will not refund a Sh122 million fine it slapped on Oriental Commercial Bank in 1993 for its involvement in the infamous Goldenberg scandal.

Judges Roselyn Nambuye, Daniel Musinga and Patrick Kiage ruled that filing the case was an afterthought and a fishing expedition as the bank did not state what rights were breached. “The respondent (Oriental) simply stated that the appellant’s act of penalising it was unconstitutional for it discriminated against the plaintiff,” the judges ruled.
