An inmate at the Wundanyi GK Prisons who dramatically escaped from custody two days ago has been re-arrested. Authorities did not give the name of the prisoner, who was nabbed on Monday evening after fleeing prison dressed in clothes stolen from prison staff. The inmate was serving a two-year jail term for stealing a motorcycle in Taita at the time of his breakout. He had only served three months.
