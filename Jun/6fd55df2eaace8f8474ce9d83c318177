Miguna's name yet to be tabled in assembly “We will table the motion before the assembly this week, I don’t want to talk much about it as it is a matter to be discussed before all members of the County Assembly,” said Elachi “Once it is tabled this week then from there it will move according to the Standing Orders,” she added. Governor Mike Sonko forwarded Miguna’s name on May 18 for vetting and approval by the county assembly.
