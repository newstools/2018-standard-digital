Nyong'o reinstates county board It took a five-hour police presence to avert further confrontation. Kisumu Central OCPD Meshack Kiptum said five teams of anti-riot police officers were dispatched to avert bloodshed and further damage. Trouble began at 9:30pm Friday night when bodaboda riders torched a matatu over allegations that it was involved in a hit-and-run incident with a motorcycle near the main bus park. “In retaliation, matatu operators roughed up riders Saturday morning at the main bus park, Kondele and Kibuye before setting the seven motorcycles ablaze,” said Mr Kiptum. This irked the riders who smashed windows of parked and passing matatus.  Businesses were hurriedly closed in fear of looting. Residents and travelers caught up in the melee had to run to safety. Even the ongoing construction of the eight kilometre stretch from the Kisumu Boys roundabout-Mamboleo junction was halted. Mr Kiptum said transport in other parts of the town remained unaffected. “Their leaders have resolved to talk,” he said. No arrests were made. Matatu owners have however pledged to continue with the protests. “The protests will not end if no suspect appears in court,” Matatu Owners Association Nyanza chief Sam Ndiege said. Bodaboda Riders Chairman Nelson Odire said tensions remained high. ALSO READ:
