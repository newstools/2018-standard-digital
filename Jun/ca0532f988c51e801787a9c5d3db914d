Two political parties, United Green Party (UGP) and Grand Dream Development Party (GDDP), have so far been issued with a certificate of registration.  Confirming the allegations, Lucy Ndung'u on Tuesday said the two political parties have been registered. To rub salt into the wound, Nandi Senator Samson Cherargei said that they were looking for a new political vehicle for the DP to contest 2022 presidential race.
