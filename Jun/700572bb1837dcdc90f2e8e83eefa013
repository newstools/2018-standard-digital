According to his son Jackson Chai, Mzungu was killed after neighbours linked the murder of a woman to his family. “My aunt Loice Ndaa was hacked to death by unknown people on May 30. We took her to hospital but she died. During her burial on June 2, the funeral programme was halted for some time after one of her sons took to the podium and declared she would not be buried until her killers are brought to book,” said Chai. He said a neighbour confessed to killing Ndaa. "He said he had been paid by our family. He was arrested and later released. The following day after burial they killed our father,” he said. Janet Chivatsi, who witnessed the killing of her father, asked the Government to assure them of their security. Stay informed while on the go by subscribing to the Standard Group SMS service.
