The Kenya Human Rights Commission has questioned delays by investigating officers to produce a comprehensive report on the Solai dam tragedy. KHRC Executive Director George Kegoro said the slow pace in releasing the report was delaying justice for individuals who lost loved ones and property worth millions when the tragedy struck on May 9.

Solai dam tragedy victims in struggle to rebuild lives “Investigating officers should have done investigations into the issue and handed a report to Director of Public Prosecutions to guarantee justice for those who lost their loved ones in the disaster,” said Mr Kegoro. On May 11, Director of Public Prosecutions Noordin Haji directed Inspector General of Police Joseph Boinnet to investigate the cause of Patel Dam tragedy that killed 47 people in Nyakinyua and Nyandarua villages in Solai. The investigating team was to hand over the report after 14 days for subsequent action. However, since the report submitted to the DPP had glaring gaps, it was returned to investigators for remedial action. Kegoro said there had been no clear communication from investigating agencies on why there was a delay in releasing the report.
