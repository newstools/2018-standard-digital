On May 30, some board members suspended Ms Wairi for two months and replaced her with Daniel Manduku in an acting capacity. On Tuesday the High Court suspended Dr Manduku's appointment and reinstated Wairi, pending the outcome of a suit filed by Emmanuel Kenga Chengo.

He said board chairman Marsden Madoka's term "expired on April 16, 2018, having been appointed for a period of three years with effect from April 17, 2015".
