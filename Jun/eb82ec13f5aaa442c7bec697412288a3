Investigations revealed that the decision to sack Ms Wairi was reached after President Uhuru Kenyatta admonished her at a State House meeting in Nairobi on February 26. The President was angered by the former KPA boss’s failure to dismantle a cartel frustrating movement of cargo by Standard Gauge Railway (SGR).
