Addressing a public meeting in Wundanyi yesterday, Mr Samboja said the construction of the governor’s residence was not his priority. The governor said the funds would be channeled to bursaries and scholarships for bright children from poor families. “I have already notified the county assembly that I do not need any residence for the time being. What I want is to see bright children from poor families get bursaries and scholarships to further their education. There is no need for me and my deputy to live in maisonettes while thousands of needy children continue dropping out of school due to lack of fees,” said Samboja. Know if news is factual and true.
