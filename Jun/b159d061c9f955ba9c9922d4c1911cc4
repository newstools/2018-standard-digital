She said the family model adopted by SoS is recognised by the United Nations guidelines and should be emulated by most organisations. “The children villages have placed high regard for families and many children have continued to transit out of the village set up and have been molded into upright socially minded adults enough with values and are now able to contribute towards the growth of our nation,” said the First Lady who is also the patron of SoS villages.
