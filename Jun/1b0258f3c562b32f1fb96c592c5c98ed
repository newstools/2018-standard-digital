The Lake Victoria Basin Commission has acquired Sh500 million to address climate change in the region. The commission's executive secretary, Ali Matano (pictured), said the funds were acquired in partnership with the United Nations Environment Programme to help in conservation efforts. The funds will complement another Sh370 million that the commission has acquired from World Bank to promote green culture and control pollution from private companies in five East African states. The region has been at the receiving end of nature’s fury. “We recently witnessed the worst floods in recent times and are almost certain that this will be followed by a drought. There is an urgent need to address adaptation to climate change,” said Dr Matano. Among the areas that the commission will focus on are the Mt Elgon transboundary ecosystem as well Lake Rweru, which straddles Rwanda and Burundi. Avoid becoming a victim of Fake News.
