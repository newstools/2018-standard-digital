The ODM party has been using the building since 2006 and it has remained party’s headquarters through three elections. The Orange House is the commonly used venue for Raila’s critical meetings with other leaders and the organisation of crucial activities of the party.

It is not yet clear where the National Secretariat of ODM party will move to after the year ends. “The National Secretariat will thus relocate to a new address at end of the year and our members, supporters and the general public will be notified accordingly,” assured Ong’wen. He added that the move is in accordance with the intention of the landlord to construct a multi- storey office block on the property which is in line with the current trends of land use in the neighbourhood. The property is owned by Raila’s former aide, Caroli Omond,i who served as principal administrative secretary in prime minister’s office between 2008 and 2013. ALSO READ:
