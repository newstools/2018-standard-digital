However, the magistrate informed the defence that it was the right of the accused person to be released on bond. The court also recorded that Asha had denied committing the offense, therefore, setting the stage for a pre-trial case. According to the charge sheet, three people are scheduled to testify for the prosecution.  The Woman Representative was released on a Sh100,000 bond with a similar surety, or an alternative cash bail of Sh50,000. The matter will be mentioned on June 28 before the same court. Hussein is the second Mombasa Woman Representative after she replaced current Likoni MP Mishi Mboko. ALSO READ:
