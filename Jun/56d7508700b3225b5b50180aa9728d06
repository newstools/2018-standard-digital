Italy sparks fears of new crisis in EU Sixty-eight others - from Tunisia and elsewhere - were rescued by the coastguard. The country has become an important new route for migrants trying to make the crossing to Europe in the past year. This comes after moves were made in neighbouring Libya against human traffickers, who have regularly enslaved, tortured or murdered migrants. Of the 180 passengers aboard the boat, about 100 were Tunisian.  It was five miles from the Kerkennah Islands and 16 nautical miles from the city of Sfax, the interior ministry said. One survivor told Reuters news agency that the captain had abandoned the boat after it started sinking to escape arrest by the coastguard. Each passenger on the fishing boat paid between €600 and €1,000 ($700-$1,170; £530-£880), an IOM spokesman told the AFP news agency.
