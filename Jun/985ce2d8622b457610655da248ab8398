On Thursday however, the ward representatives unanimously passed a motion seeking to compel the two bodies to tour the region and review the boundaries in contention. Caren Muga, a nominated MCA who crafted the motion said there is a dire need for the two bodies to come and clear the air on the boundaries to quell tension between communities living at the border. She criticised calls by Nandi Governor Stephen Sang to have the county claim parts of Kisumu as uncalled for adding that the move is set to jeopardise peaceful coexistence between families living at the border.  “Governor Sang’ should come clean and tell us whether the clashes at the Kisumu/ Nandi border were a wider scheme to extend the boundaries,” said Muga. She said that the move by Nandi County is set to derail the country’s quest to move forward after several months of politics. Members of  Parliament- Aduma Owuor (Nyakach),  Dr James  Nyikal (Seme) and Kisumu  County Assembly  Majority leader Ken Onyango  told Nandi leaders pushing for  a boundary review  to be prepared  for  a long drawn out battle.
