Mr Lumumba said the attackers, numbering between four and eight arrived on a Kenyan boat. The attackers first hijacked five Kenyan boats and took away their engines.

Bondo MP Gideon Ochanda who condemned the incident, said that it was very unfortunate that Kenyan security officers were being held unlawfully in the neighbouring country. "More than five hours after our police officers were attacked and hijacked by Ugandan soldiers, the government has not given any statement concerning the same," said Ochanda.
