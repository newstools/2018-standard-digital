NAIROBI, KENYA: Businessman Peter Munga’s Plum LLP wants to sell its entire stake in Britam to Switzerland-based firm Swiss Re Asset Management Geneva SA. Britam said in a statement on Monday that Plum LLP had entered into a share purchase agreement with Swiss Re in a deal that will see the latter purchase 348.5 million shares from the former.

Plum Holdings is jointly owned by Mr Munga, Filimbi Ltd - an investment vehicle associated with Equity Bank Chief Executive James Mwangi - and Equity Holdings. In 2016, the firm acquired the shares as an interim measure to allow Britam and its shareholders to identify a suitable investor.  This was after the Mauritian Government offered for sale the stake it seized from disgraced tycoon Dawood Rawat. Mr Munga had made it clear that Plum LLP would dispose of the shares within 24 months from July 31, 2016, the date on which the shares were transferred to it.
