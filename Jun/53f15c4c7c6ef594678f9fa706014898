A quarantine on cattle in the county has been extended by a month to contain an outbreak of anthrax. Agriculture Executive Paul Mbuni said movement of animals would remain banned to give veterinary officers time to wipe out the disease. ALSO READ:

I want to assure farmers that the government will deal with the disease.” He said areas that had been hard hit by the disease included parts of Hamisi and Luanda sub-counties. Vaccinating animals  “Veterinary officers are in the field visiting farmers and vaccinating their animals. We are doing the exercise in collaboration with ward administrators, chiefs and their assistants because they are close to the affected farmers,” he said. Mbuni also pointed out that he was impressed with the response after the vaccination drive was launched in villages. He urged farmers to report any cases of anthrax to his office for quick action to be taken. The county last month banned movement of cattle following the outbreak. Last week, traders appealed to Governor Wilber Ottichilo to intervene and have the ban lifted, claiming the disease had been contained. ALSO READ:
