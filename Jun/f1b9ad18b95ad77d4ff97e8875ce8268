He warned that parents would also be arrested and prosecuted if they were found protecting their children who had committed a crime. “We will not spare parents. If you are not taking care of your child who turns to crime then we will arrest you and charge you because as a parent, you enjoy the money your child brings home without asking the source,” said Leparmarai.
