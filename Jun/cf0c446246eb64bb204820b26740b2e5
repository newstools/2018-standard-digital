Karua ally testifies against her The patent, which was first spotted by CNN, describes a system that detects a passenger’s behaviour, before deciding whether they’re allowed to get in the taxi. To do this, the system would track how you normally use the Uber app - including your speed of typing, number of typos, how you tap the buttons, and the way the phone is being held. It could then detect if you’re using the app in an irregular way, and whether you’re drunk. The patent said: “The system receives the trip request from a user and generates a prediction about the current state of the user using the computer model. Avoid becoming a victim of Fake News.

For example, if you ordered an Uber in an area with lots of bars in the early hours of the morning, this suggests that you could be more likely to be drunk. ALSO READ:

While the system could be used to prevent drunk and disorderly passengers from riding, CNN pointed out that it could be a draw for some drivers. According to the site, there have been over 100 cases of abuse and assault by Uber drivers in the past four years - and in many of these cases, passengers were drunk. mirror.co.uk has contacted Uber for comment.
