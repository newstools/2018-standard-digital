Jumwa further stressed she had no problems with ODM leader Raila Odinga.  "If Junet thinks he can threaten me, then let me send him a warning that I am unshaken and I am not a commissioner because of him but it's a right I deserve," she said. Jumwa reiterated she would continue supporting Ruto and campaign for his presidential bid. "I have already made up my mind that I will support one William Ruto for the presidency in 2022," she declared. According to sources within ODM, the plot to remove Jumwa was just the beginning of a major crackdown on the 'rebel MPs'. ALSO READ:
