Our healthcare system has gone to the dogs There are 14 level four hospitals in Meru. Igembe North has Mutuate Hospital only, the same as Igembe Central and Igembe South with Nyambene and Kangeta respectively. Abothuguchi West MCA Patrick Muthuri complained that Central Imenti sub-county does not have a level four hospital. “For a hospital to become a level four, it has to have a theatre for surgeries and other services,” said Mr Muthuri.

Upgrade demand Jediel Mutura (Ntunene-Igembe North), who has written to the health executive on behalf of residents who are demanding an upgrade of Laare Health Centre, said it was unfair to deny some regions better healthcare services. He said Igembe Central serves a large population, from the border with Isiolo all the way to Meru National Park and therefore deserves elevation of more facilities to level four. Joshua Mauru (Ntima East) and Elias Murega (Municipality) said the county government needed to upgrade hospitals in marginalised areas. ALSO READ:
