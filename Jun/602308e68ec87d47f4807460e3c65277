Mr Wambua on his part reiterated that in partnership with the national government, the county had increased its capacity to collect garbage and the county would be squeaky clean in three months' time. "Cleaning will now be done through participation by community based organisations. I also urge nairobians to engage in the monthly clean-up day because cleanliness is an individual and collective responsibility," added Wambua.

MCA Morris Nyaga in plea over garbage collection in Embu Governor Sonko that the contracts for firms hired to clean up the city and transport the waste to the Dandora dumpsite had expired. Citing the wanting state of garbage collection in some city estates and backstreets, Sonko said his administration was not keen on renewing the contracts. "We have decided not to renew the contracts because we are trying to avoid the same old problems. When I was younger, garbage collection was done by the defunct (Nairobi City) council. We want to revert this role to the county," he stated. The Nairobi regeneration committee which he is the chair together with tourism Cs Najib Balala, said the Sh700 million previously used to pay garbage collection contractors would be used to pay youths to do the job. The move to have a clean-up day is aimed at emulating Rwanda which has achieved environmental gains through such measures. The directive comes barely a month after City hall directed that only two vehicles in a Sacco will be accessing the city stages in a bid to combat traffic congestion. ALSO READ:
