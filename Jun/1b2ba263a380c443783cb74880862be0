Some of the MPs openly asked Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho to drop Raila Odinga and join William Ruto in the 2022 elections. Mombasa Woman Representative Mishi Mboko declared her support for William Ruto and asked Joho to join him come 2022.  "Ruto says he a hustler, I know Joho is a hustler too, let them form hustlers' alliance and move Kenya forward," she said. Barely two months ago, Malindi MP Aisha Jumwa also publicly endorsed William Ruto for the top seat. "We can’t stop an idea whose time has come. 2022, it’s William Ruto. We want to assure you of our support when that time comes,” Jumwa said. ALSO READ:
