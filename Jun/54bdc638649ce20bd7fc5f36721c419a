The top two suspects in the National Youth Service scandal will now taste freedom after a Nairobi court declined an application to keep them in custody.

It added that DPP could only make an objection against a specific property. Mr Karuri made the application when suspended PS Lilian Omollo met all the bonds requirements of up to Sh8 million to secure her release. Ndubai paid the cash bail and deposited the log book of his car valued at Sh4 million while his brother stood as his surety. Another suspect, Director of Arkroad Holdings Ltd Peter Kimani also met all the requirements imposed by the court. Know if news is factual and true.
