The firm, which built the railway and later mandated to operate it, said it had increased the capacity of the express and intercounty service by 590 seats to 1652 by adding five coaches to the trains. “We get a high number of people over the three days and to cater for the needs of weekend travel, we have added five economy coaches on all trains on Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays,” said Zhu Yunpeng of CRBC. On a normal day, the train can take 1,062 passengers but with the additional five coaches that have a capacity of 590, it can take 1652 people.
