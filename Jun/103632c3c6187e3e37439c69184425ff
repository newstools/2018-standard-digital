The committee chairman, Robert Mbatia, said the budget was over-ambitious as the executive needed to balance recurrent expenditure with development estimates. “The executive feels that the budget should be fully funded at Sh34 billion, but we are still negotiating. We feel that they are not able to fund the budget fully and therefore need to revise it,” stated Mr Mbatia. He added that if the proposed budget was approved there would be a Sh7 billion deficit.

He noted that Sh8.2 billion was collected in local revenue against a target of Sh17 billion, a few days to the end of the 2017/18 financial year. The county finance executive, Charles Kerich, said the annual revenue collection stood at Sh9 billion and another Sh16.5 billion was expected from the National Treasury. ALSO READ:
