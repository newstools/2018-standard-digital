Uganda maize adds to Kenyan farmersâ€™ misery Agriculture Cabinet Secretary Mwangi Kiunjuri yesterday toured the plant and assured that it had the capacity to produce 10 tonnes of Aflasafe every day with a potential to scale up production to 40 tonnes. "We are coming up with a policy which I will push through the Cabinet to ensure every farmer uses Aflasafe," Mr Kiunjuri said. He said this would cushion farmers against crop losses and ensure food security which is among the Government's 'big four' agenda. Other measures the Government was taking to ensure food sufficiency include introducing farmers to water-fed agriculture, developing new maize seed varieties which give yields within 120 days.
