"The handshake has temporarily disoriented the opposition, and this had weakened the oversight role it played. It is becoming difficult to challenge the government and this is not a good thing for the country," said Mudavadi. Though Mudavadi supports the handshake for having cooled the tempers in the country he is worried that the stiffing of the opposition could have a negative impact on democracy and governance. He said; "We currently have a conflicted approach to the role of the opposition, our partners in ODM no longer know where they seat in the arrangement, whether they in government or not."
