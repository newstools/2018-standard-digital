Parents who went to check on their children said they could not extinguish the fire as it was fiercely spreading.  "We rushed to the school to check on the children but luckily no one was injured.Â  We hope the school will do thorough investigation to establish the real cause of the fire, "said Teresa Murugi. The county director for education Yusuf Jilo said they suspected the fire was caused by an electric fault. Incidentally one day before the students broke for midterm two weeks ago, another dorm caught fire destroying properties belonging to form four students. "We find it strange because the first incident happened similar to this one because it happened at about 8pm and the students were breaking for holiday. In this one the boys had just reported back from midterm, "said Jilo. ALSO READ:
