Is Jumwa’s a case of musical chairs? Speaking in Kwale on Saturday during the homecoming party of Kwale Deputy Speaker Andrew Mulei, the Kanu MP claimed the legislators were being misused by the DP to solidify support for his 2022 presidential bid. “I ask them (ODM rebels), if they support Raila Odinga, who is now with President Uhuru, why should they then go to the DP when they are more close to the presidency?” posed Mr Kamket. A recent Coast tour by Ruto and Gideon has created rifts among local leaders. Several ODM MPs have declared support for the DP. Kamket said the Kenyatta, Raila and Moi axis would guarantee the region economic, political and social prosperity.
