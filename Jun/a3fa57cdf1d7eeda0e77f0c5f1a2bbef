Migori’s buffalo bellows even in the quiet of death Many factors have been cited for increased cases of cancer but specialists are investigating what they have termed as a phenomenon in Kiegoi. County Hospice coordinator Gladys Mucee said they are concerned that the area has cancer patients more than other part of the county. Many schools have lost teachers and a number of farmers have also died from cancer in the area over the past few years. “We are yet to establish why Kiegoi seems to have so many cases of cancer compared to other parts of Meru. A research is being undertaken to establish what is causing this,” Mucee said.  Opinion is still divided over the cause of the many cases of cancer that have been reported, not just in Kiegoi but in the whole county. Dr William Murrah has attributed the outbreak of cancer in the area to excessive use of miraa, alcohol and cigarettes. "Many cases of brain and lung cancer have been reported in Kiegoi and Akachiu. We are not sure but this is partly caused by chewing miraa and smoking," he said. Recently, after a screening in Kiegoi, over 20 men were referred to Meru Level Five Hospital after they were found to be suffering from prostate cancer. ALSO READ:
