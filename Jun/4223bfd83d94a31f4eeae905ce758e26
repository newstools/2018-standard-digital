Kenyatta, who was elected for a second term last year, has spoken out recently against graft and urged the judiciary “to ensure fair trials and justice”.

But even before looking at the other aspect that I have told you, probably more than half of the Sh8 billion pending bills are questionable,” he said. “We have only looked at only one branch within NYS. And there are other branches that we are looking at and investigations are going on.”
