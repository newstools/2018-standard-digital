Nigerian actor and comedian Benjamin Nwachukwu, known to his fans as Shuga Shaa, has drawn a mixed reaction in the commercial capital, Lagos, for saying he has a relationship with a sex doll named Tonto Shaa. The pampered doll sports a wig, polished finger nails and wears jewellery and expensive perfumes - and now has her own car. Shuga Shaa has been spotted going to the cinema and driving around with her on some occasions. Some fans expressed disappointment and disgust, even describing him as a "mad man" and a "psychopath". Others put it all down to humour and played along with him. Shuga Shaa has hit out at critics, saying, "Tonto was produced by a human like you and I. There is no spirit in her." Avoid fake news!
