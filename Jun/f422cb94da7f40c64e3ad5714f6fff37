Video from the scene, which has gone viral online, shows the ladder slip just as the casket enters the tower, sending the men tumbling several meters to the ground where the victim is struck by the coffin. Horrified onlookers rush to the men’s aid but Kondorura died later in hospital. Know if news is factual and true. Text 'NEWS' to 22840 and always receive verified news updates.
