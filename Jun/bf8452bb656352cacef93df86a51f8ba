Why your governor’s expensive mansion should bother you Dr Muraah denied employing Virginia Kawira Nkoroi as the county health finance manager on Job Group P on November 4, 2015, thus committing an abuse of office offence by conferring an improper benefit. He denied conferring another improper benefit by employing Doris M’Mbui as chief nursing services manager on Job Group P on the same date in 2015. Muraah further denied having irregularly appointed Rachael Gacheri Silas as laboratory services manager at the Meru Level Five Hospital on Job Group N on the same date. All the three appointments are alleged to have been done without the approval of the Meru County Public Service Board.  Muraah’s lawyer, Hosea Mutembei, successfully applied to have his client released on bond and undertook that he (Muraah) would attend court sessions. “He is not a flight risk and is currently a medical doctor working in Marsabit,” said the lawyer while also applying for copies of charge sheet and statements of prosecution witnesses. Ms Abuya ordered Muraah to be released on Sh500,000 cash bail or Sh1 million bond with a surety of a similar amount. The case will be heard on August 1. ALSO READ:
