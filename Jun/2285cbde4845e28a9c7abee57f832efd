The Mount Kenya Professionals Association was also represented. They criticised Deputy President William Ruto’s allies for opposing the audit, claiming it was targeting him. They told some Jubilee leaders to stop insulting the President and stop sabotaging the fight against corruption. “We are not interested in 2022, we want to see the country unified and peaceful as it is currently,” said Mr Kabando. The leaders expressed support for the political truce between Raila and Uhuru.  “We have people going round the country trying to downplay the handshake. We want to tell you to stop it and put the interest of the country at heart and not your own. We are here to declare total and unapologetic support,” the former Mukurwe-ini lawmaker added. They urged political leaders to concentrate on delivering on pre-election promises, as time for political rhetoric was over. They urged the President and Raila to remain together and correct the mistakes that were made in the 1960s. The leaders urged their counterparts to rally behind Uhuru to ensure the country moves in the right direction. ALSO READ:
