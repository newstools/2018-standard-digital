He later left him for the dead,” said Peter Ndung’u, a resident. Mr Ndung’u said police officers who later saw a badly injured Kimani outside the station took him to a nearby hospital, where when was pronounced dead on arrival. Family members said they did not know that their kin was dead until a day later when they got wind that his body was in Kigumo mortuary.  “We were shocked to see his body... We are still seeking answers as to why we were kept in the dark despite the fact that the police knew his home,” said an aunt to the deceased. Residents and family members yesterday held a peaceful demonstration to demand justice. Chanting anti-police slogans, they engaged the officers in running battles for several hours. Kimani’s father, Wathiru Kimani, said they would not rest until Kimani’s killers are apprehended. “We want to see the person who committed the heinous act, even if he or she is a police officer, arraigned in court. Nobody is above the law,” he said. ALSO READ:
