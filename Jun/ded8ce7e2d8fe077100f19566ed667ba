"This flag-off event and the anticipated implementation of the Early Oil Pilot (EOP) Scheme marks the beginning of a long and fruitful journey," said President Kenyatta when he spoke after flagging off the crude oil laden trucks.  The President, who was accompanied by Deputy President William Ruto, said what Kenya stands to gain from the production and exportation of petroleum products cannot be understated. He said the production of petroleum products will strengthen the existing economic and commercial partnerships and enhance the opportunities for growth and investments within the country. "My Government will therefore focus on the development of our oil and gas sectors for the betterment of the economy and people," said the President. The President said the initial petroleum exports will complement the country’s existing development projects under the BIG 4 agenda. ALSO READ:
