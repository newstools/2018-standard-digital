According to police, the officers were trailing animals that had been stolen from Samburu side and driven towards Nasoroi village where they were found. The team was accompanied by the owners of the animals. And as they loaded the animals onto a lorry the attackers opened fire from a hilly place sending the team into disarray. A fire exchange ensued for almost 20 minutes with some officers withdrawing from the warzone enabling the attackers to drive away the stolen animals. ALSO READ:
