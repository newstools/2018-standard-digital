He however said the county government had put into place measures to arrest the loss of revenue through forged liquor licences. Outlining plans to stem corruption in his docket and ensure optimal revenue collection, Kariuki said they had introduced new licences with advanced safety features that backstreet printing firms would not be able to replicate. “Only the chief officer is authorised to sign liquor licences.

He expressed confidence that the department would meet its revenue target of Sh29 million in the next financial year, adding they had collected Sh9 million in three days when they started fresh licensing of bars in the county this week. Kariuki said his officers had also received more than 2,000 applications for liquor licences for the three categories of Sh20,000, Sh25,000 and Sh30,000.
