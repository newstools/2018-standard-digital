She had vied for the position on her Narc-Kenya ticket while her rival (Waiguru) ran on the popular Jubilee party ticket. Among the issues Karua cited in her petition were the barring of her agents into various polling stations on Election Day, bribery of voters and conversing with voters at the queue allegedly by a Jubilee operative, Muriithi Kang'ara.
