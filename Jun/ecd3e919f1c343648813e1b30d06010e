A parliamentary watchdog committee has directed the Auditor General to undertake an urgent forensic audit on alleged Sh1.9 billion maize scandal.

Mr Sang also told the committee, chaired by Mvita MP Abdulswamad Nassir, that the Ministry of Agriculture was verifying stock in NCPB depots in Kisumu, Bungoma, Moi’s Bridge and Kitale to ascertain if the maize alleged to have been bought was stocked in the stores. But the committee queried the ability of the ministry to make full disclosure on the scandal and the status of the grain in the said silos, with Mr Nassir saying it was suspicious that the Government had never considered ordering for a special audit on the matter. The legislator noted that even the ongoing verification had not been initiated by Sang, who only assumed office two weeks ago following the resignation of former boss Newton Teren.
