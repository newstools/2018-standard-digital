The area is of significant importance to members of the Kipsigis community since it was where the community used to conduct circumcision rites. The most affected areas are Tulwap and Ewat village. The cracks are currently at least 1,000 meters long and four feet deep. “One of the cracks has stopped just outside the homestead of one of the Tulwap villagers. The ground is soggy due to the heavy rains which have been pounding the area,” said Korir. Avoid fake news!

Geologists warn that, as happened some 25-30 million years ago, when Africa broke away from Eurasia at the Arabian Peninsula, similar rifts could be in the offing.
