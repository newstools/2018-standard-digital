The police boss said that the deceased person has not yet been identified with his body lying at the Kapkatet Hospital Mortuary in Kericho County awaiting postmortem and identification to be carried out. Nickson Ongaki, one of the passengers in the vehicle told The Standard of their harrowing experience at the hands of Otieno who picked them up at the Kangemi stage in Nairobi on the way to Kisii on Friday evening as they waited to board buses plying the route.  Ongaki said that Otieno was driving the vehicle at high speed and refused several appeals by his four passengers to reduce the speed and at one point threatened to shoot them. “Otieno narrowly escaped hitting several vehicles at various spots, we requested him to slow down but he was very arrogant, our fears were confirmed when he hit and killed a pedestrian at Chebilat as we were almost coming to the end of our journey,” said Ongaki.
