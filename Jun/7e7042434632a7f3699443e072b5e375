In response to the request, Speaker John Kaguchia said the House was conducting an internal probe and that the same matter would be investigated by the Powers and Privileges committee. The 10-member committee was constituted during a special sitting of the House barely three weeks after the assault claims. Mr Kaguchia said the committee was taking the assault claims seriously and would complete investigation in 30 days. ALSO READ:
