Why Turkana residents want oil money in their pockets, not projects More than 10,000 people in Soweto, Napetet, Kawalase, Nabute and Nakwalele and Loitaktok villages were displaced after their houses were destroyed by floods. But in a sad turn of events, residents of Kawalasee village, situated a kilometre from Lodwar Town, are faced with a serious shortage of water, just a month after the heavy rains across the country.

"You have to be there early to dig a hole and wait for it to fill up with water from the soil. It is not easy to fill just one container and this delays everything you are doing," said Akiru yesterday. However, Water Executive Emathe Namuar said they had developed a law to enhance access to water by residents.
