The operation was carried out by a joint team of police officers and police reservists but were also helped by the locals. Mr Kibaara said the officers are still in the area pursuing the suspects and will remain there until they find the militants. “I want to assure all of you that we will not leave the area until we find all the militants or those who sympathise with them,” said Mr Kibaara.  Security agencies launched an operation in Tarbaj and Wajir East sub-counties after eight security officers were killed in an IED attack in Bojigaras last week. The militants made away with fire arms and ammunition belonging to the officers and escaped towards Somalia border during the attack.
