Mr Limo, however, said police were following leads to two suspects named by the witnesses. “The officers are following all the possible leads. The problem is that the one who took Muchangi to hospital and who has recorded a statement said he only mentioned a single name for each of the suspects. We hope somebody will assist us with more information,” Limo said. Muchangi died last Wednesday after being in a comma for six days. ALSO READ:
