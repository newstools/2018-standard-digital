Body of a one-month-old baby girl was found floating in River Molo in Soin Ward, Rongai Sub-county on Saturday morning. Rongai police boss Japheth Kioko said the body was discovered by a local who was crossing the river at around 7.30am. Mr Kioko said it has not been established whether the minor drowned or was dumped in the river by the mother. “The body was discovered in the river and we are yet to establish if it was a case of drowning or being dumped,” said Kioko. The OCPD said no parent has reported to the police station to notify them of a missing incident of their child, an issue making it difficult to trace the mother. The body was picked to Nakuru County morgue for postmortem as police commence investigation to trace family members. Avoid fake news!
