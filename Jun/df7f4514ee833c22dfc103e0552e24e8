According to the parents of the alleged victims, the police officer had been luring the children to his house and showing them computer games on his laptop. They claimed that the officer would give the children money or threaten them with dire consequences if they told anybody about the assault. A parent said he realised his son had a problem when a neighbour heard him describe his experiences at the hands of the policeman to other boys.
