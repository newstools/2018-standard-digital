High cost of drugs to hurt Universal Health Care, warns expert Housing Principal Secretary Charles Mwaura Thursday met Governor Anyang’ Nyong’o in efforts to finalise the implementation of the project. According to the principal secretary, Kisumu is among 45 counties that have benefited from the grant, given to the Government in form of a loan by the World Bank. Nairobi and Mombasa were left out. The project aims at providing affordable housing, which the PS said, was in line with the national government’s Big Four agenda. Mr Mwaura said all the plans for the implementation of the project were over, with public participation set to begin in the next two weeks.  “One of the conditions of the grant was that the benefiting towns or municipalities have proper plans, and since Kisumu already has one, it is ahead of the pack and it will be among the front runners in implementing the plan,” he said. Even though the project only targets housing, the planning will encompass schools, roads, hospitals, markets among other public facilities. “We want people to get all the facilities within their residential areas, we will closely work with the private sector to come up with some of these facilities,” said Mwaura. Once completed, the houses will be sold at a cost of between Sh2 million and Sh3 million, depending on the size. ALSO READ:
