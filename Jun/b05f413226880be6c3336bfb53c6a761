88 and 83 year old sentenced to life in prison for defilement Two deputy principals, the boarding mistress and matron were asked to narrate the events of that day. Boarding mistress Celestine Mutiso said she found the victim in uniform and seated on a bed next to a fellow student. She was crying. “I asked her if she had bathed, and she said 'no'. I took the two to the car, came back and fetched two more and took the students to Nairobi Women’s Hospital," she said. The committee said mystery lay in the fact that no alarm was raised despite claims that some students witnessed the ordeal.
