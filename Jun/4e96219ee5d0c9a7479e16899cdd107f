Speaking during Madaraka Day celebrations, Kiraitu said funds for the project had been provided by the national Government. Residents at Kinoru and other estates have complained of the inconvenience, as public and private transport vehicles pass through their homes to escape traffic jams on the main road. Kiraitu thanked President Uhuru Kenyatta for monetary assistance to actualise the project.  “I want to thank you for providing funds through Kenya National Highway Authority (KeNHA) to construct a dual carriage highway from Gitimbine to Gitooro to address the serious traffic congestion,” said the governor. Deputy Governor Titus Ntuchiu said Meru town was growing fast, with new malls and other business premises coming up. “The dual carriageway is something we are very happy about,” said Mr Ntuchiu.
