City Hall moves to save maize flour prices Nominated MCA Doris Kanario (pictured) proposed the motion, saying many mothers are unable to breastfeed and bond with their children because of ridicule and discrimination. “Lactating mothers often feel ashamed of breastfeeding in public and semi-public places due to possibility of potential objections or other people, negative comments or harassment, not to mention the discomfort and health risk to mothers," she said. Kanario added that she is disturbed by cases of mothers being denied the privilege to nurse their children publicly. “Every person has the right to have their dignity protected." She said City Hall should establish conducive breastfeeding and nursing areas that will be licensed by the Nairobi County Government. Your opinion is valuable.
