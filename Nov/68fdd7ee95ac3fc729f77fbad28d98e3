The announcement was made during the World Diabetes Day celebrations at Emusire Primary School in Vihiga County early in the week. The platform, which is powered by Safaricom in partnership with the Ministry of Health and the Non-Communicable Diseases Alliance of Kenya, aims to address the information gap on the prevention, management and care of non-communicable diseases. “Fafanuka will leverage SMS and USSD to educate public, patients, nurses, community health workers and caregivers on how to prevent, screen, diagnose, manage and follow up various non-communicable diseases. To register for the service all one needs to do is dial *215# from their Safaricom line and follow the instructions,” said Dr Joseph Kibachio, Head of Non-Communicable Diseases Division in the Ministry of Health. According to the World Health Organisation, non-communicable diseases contribute to more than 50 per cent of inpatient cases in Kenya and 40 per cent of hospital deaths. Your opinion is valuable.
