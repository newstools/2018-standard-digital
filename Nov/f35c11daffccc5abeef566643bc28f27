The North Rift Economic Bloc (Noreb) has set up a secretariat as member counties seek to breathe new lease of life in the stalled economic partnership. Noreb chairman Jackson Mandago yesterday told The Standard they had also appointed Dominic Biwott the acting chief executive officer. “We have approved the operationalisation of the secretariat that will be hosted at the Kerio Valley Development Authority (KVDA) plaza and...consequently tasked each member county to second staff,” said Mr Mandago, who is also the Uasin Gishu Governor. He said members had agreed to establish Noreb offices in their areas of jurisdiction and appoint a liaison officer who would be reporting directly to the secretariat. “The county speakers have been asked to coordinate the establishment of Noreb county assemblies’ forum for purposes of representation and oversight of Noreb activities. We shall develop a development blueprint that shall be aligned with the national Government's Big Four agenda alongside the respective county (development programmes),” Mandago added. The county chief said they would establish a Noreb investment and commercial development authority. The agency, once operational, will have capacity to enter into agreements and partnerships with other agencies such as regional development authorities like KVDA. Your opinion is valuable.

He dismissed claims that the economic bloc had remained moribund since its formation two years ago. “The electioneering period was tasking and it consequently impeded our operational plan and with the coming of the stated measures, we are sure of achieving our intended goals,” said Mandago.
