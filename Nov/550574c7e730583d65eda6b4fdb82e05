Uhuru commissions 151 officer cadets- Photos Acting Kenya Revenue Authority (KRA) Commissioner for Customs and Border Control Kenneth Ochola said the launch paves the way for speedy clearance of goods moving between the two countries. He said the Namanga OSBP is part of the EAC regional initiative implemented jointly with Kenya and Tanzania. It was supported by development partners through Japan International Cooperation Agency and African Development Bank. Ochola said the launch will open up the border for better trade between Tanzania and Kenya. Namanga OSBP was first opened in October 2017. "The OSBP has since eradicated the many bottlenecks that stood in the way of efficient service delivery at the facility. One of the major scores realised after its establishment has been reduction in the time taken to clear people and goods from Kenya to Tanzania and vice versa," Ochola said.
