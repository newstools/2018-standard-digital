Women who love a lie-in have a higher risk of developing breast cancer, a new study has warned. Researchers from the University of Bristol have analysed the link between sleeping patterns and breast cancer in women. ALSO READ:

In the study, the researchers looked at data from 409,166 women - some who have had breast cancer, and some without the disease. Dr Rebecca Richmond, who led the study, said: “Using genetic variants associated with people's preference for morning or evening, sleep duration and insomnia, which had previously been identified by three recent UK Biobank genome-wide association studies, we investigated whether these sleep traits have a causal contribution to the risk of developing breast cancer. Their analysis revealed that women with a preference for mornings reduced the risk of breast cancer by 40%, compared with being an evening type. It also found that women who slept longer than seven to eight hours a night had a 20 percent increased risk of the disease per additional hour slept. Avoid fake news!

Dr Richmond added: “We would like to use genetic data from large populations to further understand how disrupting the body's natural body clock can contribute to breast cancer risk.” ALSO READ:
