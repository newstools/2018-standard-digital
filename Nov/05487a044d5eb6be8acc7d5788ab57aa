Homa Bay MCAs have differed over impeachment of County Assembly Speaker Elizabeth Ayoo (above). One faction said Ayoo was voted out by 47 of the 60 members, a claim another faction led by former majority leader Richard Ogindo dismissed. In a motion tabled by Ruma Kaksingri MCA Ellyphalet Osuri, MCAs accused Ayoo of poor leadership and mismanagement of resources. ALSO READ:

Assembly officer faces charges of mace theft “Her laxity is to blame for the disappearance of the mace. She allowed unauthorised people to access the mace,” he said. However, the Ogindo-led faction claimed the sitting, which was used to impeach the speaker, was illegal and the members did not meet the threshold required by the Assembly Standing Orders. Ogindo said the quest by their colleagues to remove Ayoo was motivated by greed. “The assembly was adjourned after chaos erupted making the sitting illegal,” he said.
