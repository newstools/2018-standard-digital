The family of former Nyanza Provincial Commissioner Isaiah Cheluget received a reprieve yesterday when the High Court in Bomet threw out a case seeking exhumation of his body. Moses Cheruiyot, 34, last year petitioned the court to order the exhumation of Mr Cheluget’s body for DNA testing to prove that he is the son of the former administrator and one of the heirs to his estate.

Kakamega man guilty of raping, killing his grandmother Justice Martin Muya dismissed the petition, saying the exhumation was not warranted in matters of succession. “It is my considered view that orders for exhumation for the purpose of taking DNA samples to ascertain the paternity in matters succession is clearly not warranted.

Kipkirui’s mother Jane Cherono swore an affidavit that Cheluget was the biological father. Avoid fake news!
