"We received information that there were three rhinos, one 37 years, another three-year old and a pregnant one under unclear circumstance," said Mr Natembeya. He however, ruled out poaching over the fact that carcasses of the black rhinos had their horns intact. "We suspect that the animals might have consumed poisonous plant but that will be revealed by the KWS report," said Natembeya.

We have KWS, County rangers and the police guarding the protected wildlife species," said Natembeya. ALSO READ:
