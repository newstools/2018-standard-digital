The two-thirds gender rule should not be misinterpreted as a ploy to favour women, Kasipul MP Ong’ondo Were has said. Mr Were, who was speaking during a fundraiser at Kabondo Kachieng’ SDA Church on Saturday, appealed to sitting female MPs not to personalise the proposed legislation during discussions. He said the Bill was not meant for women's affairs only, arguing that it would help the country resolve issues surrounding gender equality. Were warned that the Bill should not be used to punish men.
