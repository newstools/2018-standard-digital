This shows that for every one male aged 15-24 who contracts the virus, there are at least five infected females in the same age group. This could explain why there are 864,600 women aged above 15 years living with HIV compared to 523,600 men, according to the report. However, more men died from Aids-related complications last year at 13,800 compared to 10,100 women. The report also notes that there were 2,830 Aids-related deaths in the 15-24 age group.

Last year's 28,200 Aids-related deaths, according to the report, are a reduction of 48 per cent compared to 2010, when the number stood at 53,900. “The decline is directly attributable to the wider access to anti-retroviral treatment (ART) made available with the roll-out of free ARTs in 2003 and the ability of the National Aids/STI Control Programme to cover treatment needs for HIV and Aids, co-infections and provide care services,” the report states.

The report indicates that the current national prevalence rate of the virus stands at 4.9 per cent according to last year's numbers, with prevalence higher among women (5.2 per cent) than men (4.5 per cent). “These new estimates confirm a decline in HIV prevalence among both men and women at both national and county levels,” reads the report.
