No matatus on the road? Here’s why Senior Principal Magistrate Liz Gicheha had ordered Ms Nzisa to pay Ms Onganga Sh100,000 every month. But Nzisa, the wife of Nakuru East MP David Gikaria, told the court she had deposited Sh20,000 in Onganga's account. Through her lawyer Pascal Mbeche, she pleaded with the court to extend the deadline to the end of the month. “She has made an effort to make a deposit, she is mobilising her resources to pay, and we do have good faith that the payment will be paid on Monday,” said Mr Mbeche.

Nzisa asked the court to allow her pay Sh20,000 monthly. The case will be mentioned on Monday.
