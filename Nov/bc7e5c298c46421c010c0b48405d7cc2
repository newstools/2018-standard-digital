Tanzanian authorities have freed two staff members of an international press watchdog who had been detained under unclear circumstances. The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) staff were arrested from their hotel rooms and passports seized. The detention of Angela Quintal, Africa programme coordinator for CPJ and Muthoki Mumo, CPJ’s Saharan Africa representative on Wednesday, was met with uproar by governments, journalists and activists. Mumo is a former Nation journalist while Quintal worked as an editor for South Africa’s Mail and Guardian.
