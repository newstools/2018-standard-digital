Bobi Wine: Why I don’t like being called politician “Our attention is drawn to the joint subversive activities of Robert Kyagulanyi popularly known as Bobi Wine and his Kenyan counterpart Babu Owino to undermine the legitimately elected government of the Republic of Uganda,” it reads in part.

Bobi Wine, who is behind a ‘people-power revolution’ in Uganda was last month in Kenya to launch a ‘Youth for Africa’ movement. Wine took Nairobi by storm - talk shows, TV interviews, lectures et al, under the wings of Embakasi East MP Babu Owino.
