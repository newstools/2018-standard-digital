Keep your decor fresh Place clear, vinyl runner mats in high-traffic areas. The runner is a good solution for placing on a carpet or hard floor to protect the floor from dirt, debris, mud and rain water. Its transparent nature ensures that the beauty, colour and aesthetics of the carpet or floor are still visible. Because of the grips underneath, the runner can be securely placed on tiles, marble, wooden and concrete floors. They are easy to wipe and can be stored when not needed.
