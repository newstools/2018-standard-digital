Police are holding talks with the National Treasury to enable police officers receive commuter allowances. Inspector General of Police Joseph Boinett told a group of officers at the weekend that negotiations for the money are ongoing to enhance movement of officers from their places of residence to work. “Negotiations for your commuter allowances are ongoing. Use what you have for now,” he told the group at the National Police Service Training Campus in Embakasi. Boinnet said police will from December 1, 2018 receive house allowances in three tires commensurate to market standards. Officers from formed police units and training institutions will be required to stay in police lines while those in general duties will stay in rented houses outside their stations if available houses are not enough. Available houses will also be paid for by the occupants. Boinett told the officers transfers are underway, but will take effect immediately after the ongoing Kenya Certificate of Secondary Examinations (KCSE) exams end. Avoid fake news!
