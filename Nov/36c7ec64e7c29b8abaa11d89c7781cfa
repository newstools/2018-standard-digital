He is sentenced to life imprisonment to send a warning to others who intend to harm innocent children,” ruled the magistrate. According to Ms Gicheha, the accused destroyed the minors' lives. “He called us while we were playing outside. We went to his house because we knew him as he often gave us food from the kiosk and hotel when mum and dad were at work,” said one of the victims. According to prosecution, a neighbour heard the three discussing the incident. The neighbour confronted them and they told her what had transpired.
