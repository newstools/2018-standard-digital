Non-performing county staff will be sacked, Governor James Ongwae has warned. Mr Ongwae said county staff were public servants and must focus on service delivery and stop political bickering. He vowed to weed out non-performing staff from his administration. "Chief officers must play their role as authorised. It cannot be business as usual. We didn’t come here to earn salaries but to deliver services to the people.” The governor said a delivery unit had been set up in his office to monitor and track the performance of each county department. "There will be rewards for those who perform well and sanctions for those who fail to deliver on agreed targets." Ongwae announced that renewal of contracts for chief officers and the county cabinet would be pegged on performance, and called for support of ward reps. Your opinion is valuable.
