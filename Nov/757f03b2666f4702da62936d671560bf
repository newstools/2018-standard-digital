Three firms Ms Omollo and former NYS Director General Richard Ndubai and dozens of public officials have been accused of conspiracy to commit an economic crime by allowing the payment of Sh167,715,700 to three companies, including Firstling Limited, Kunjiwa Enterprises and Ameritrade Limited. In the recently amended charges, Ms Omollo is facing three counts of abuse of office and willful failure to comply with procedures and guidelines relating to management of public funds. She is alleged to have authorised the payment of Sh115 million to Firstling Supplies, approving the payment of Sh28.7 million to Ameritrade and payment of Sh23.4 million to Kunjiwa enterprises. The directors of Firstling and Kunjiwa are accused of fraudulent acquisition of public funds. Accountants Isaiah Chapia, Keziah Wanjugu, Timothy Kiplagat and Jackson Juma are accused of false accounting. ? This comes at a time when detectives investigating how Sh8 billion was lost in the NYS II scandal have found two vouchers that had been lost, which were used to pay millions of shillings to some little known family. The vouchers are among documents prosecutors want to attach as evidence in the trial of 35 individuals, as they seek to prove that Catherine Wanjiku Mwai, Lucy, Anne, Phyllis and Jeremiah Ngirita received Sh918 million though they had not supplied anything to the NYS.
