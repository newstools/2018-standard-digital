She said the second phase of garbage removal would start next week. "We did a decommissioning study that found that we need to treat the waste with chemicals to avoid bad smell, and be able to use it to make compost manure among other things," she said.

Naivasha hit by waste management crisis Ombara disclosed that they had acquired land in Chiga at a cost of Sh50 million, where they would dump waste in the second phase. The move comes as local scientists, led by Dr Raphael Kapiyo, asked authorities to build a waste-to-energy plant to turn tonnes of garbage in Kisumu into electricity. The experts made the recommendations after carrying out an intensive environmental impact assessment in Kisumu, to advice the authorities on how to manage the waste. And city authorities disclosed a new contract to haul the garbage out of town had been awarded to Naya Holdings. Ombara told The Standard that they expect to do 8,500 trips in the second phase to clear the garbage in Kachok.
