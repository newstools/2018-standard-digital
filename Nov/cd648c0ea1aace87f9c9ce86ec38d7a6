Medics at Mbagathi said her condition was severe and referred her to Kenyatta National Hospital for specialised treatment. “I decided to go back to my house since I had no money to pay at KNH,” she told the Saturday Standard. Ochanda said her only crime was that she had gone to follow up on complaints by her four-and-half-year-old daughter that she had been beaten up by the neibhour’s 10-year-old boy. “When I knocked on the door and called out my neibghour, the door was opened and I was dragged inside.
