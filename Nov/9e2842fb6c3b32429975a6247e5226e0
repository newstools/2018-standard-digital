 A Police officer shot dead his wife following a domestic dispute on Wednesday evening at their living quarters at the Kilgoris Police Station in Narok County. Confirming the incident, Trans Mara West OCPD David Wambua said Constable Solomon Muchui engaged his wife Eunice Kerubo in a quarrel over some unknown reasons after which a fight broke out. Wambua said that Kerubo seriously injured her husband on the head after hitting him with a hammer prompting Muchui to respond by fatally shooting her dead before he was rushed to the Trans Mara West Sub County Hospital. “Kerubo’s body is currently at the Saint Joseph Mission Hospital Mortuary while Muchui was referred to the Kisii County Hospital after being treated at the Trans Mara West Hospital,” said Wambua. Wambua said that the incident has shocked the police fraternity at the Kilgoris Police Station since the officer was known to be quiet, polite and dedicated to duty with least expectations that he would kill his wife. The Police boss said that Muchui had served at the Kilgoris Police Station for one year being his first posting after graduating from the Kiganjo Police College and that he had met Kerubo in Kilgoris Town after which they started cohabiting.

Wambua said that deceased has left behind an eight-year-old daughter and that the officer was responding well to treatment. His gun was taken away from him. "We would like to call on Police officers to sort out any disputes they may be having with their spouses amicably instead of resorting to using their guns, which will end up causing more problems,” said Wambua. According to people known to the officer and his late wife the two were frequently involved in domestic disputes that ended up with them fighting, especially after they were intoxicated.
