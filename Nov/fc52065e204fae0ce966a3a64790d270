Tea firms deny that they underpay land rates The growers expressed their displeasure after this year's bonus payment declined by Sh263 million and accused the factory's board of directors of failing to explain the steep loss. “The government should conduct investigations on the performance of the factory and ensure there is good governance practice. The small-scale farmers are confused after their hopes of getting more returns from their crop were shattered," said former Kanyenya-ini MCA Peter Kihungi. Mr Kihungi spoke barely a week after Kenya Tea Development Agency (KTDA)-contracted farmers received their annual tea bonuses. He said local farmers were paid Sh37.30 per kilogramme down from Sh48 the previous year. Murang’a KTDA board member Francis Macharia, however, blamed the low bonus on increased tea hawking in Kanyenya-ini and its environs, adding that farmers had been made aware of the matter. KTDA spokesman Kithae Kidiga said the factory had failed to produce huge volumes like other tea-processing plants across the country. Know if news is factual and true.
