The bodies of two students who drowned in River Yala on Saturday while taking photos have been retrieved. The recovery ended a five-day agony for their families and friends who had been camping at the river bank since the incident happened, in line with Luo traditions. According to Luo traditions, no one is allowed to cry before all the bodies have been retrieved. This tradition was broken when the body of Derrick Auka was retrieved first. Shallete Atieno's body was retrieved afterwards.
