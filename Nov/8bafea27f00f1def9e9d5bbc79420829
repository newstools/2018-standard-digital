 NAIROBI, KENYA: Pensioners will now be able to access their accounts including statements through a touch of a button. This follows the launch of a mobile application and an online portal to enhance operational efficiency and customer service experience of CIC Group pension clients. Dubbed the “CIC Jipange Pension Plan app and web portal”, the platforms are customer service interfaces which enable members to actively interact with their pension accounts, including statements as well as provision to amend their beneficiary details. “This launch is in line with CIC’s vision of product and process innovation as well as the provision of convenient and efficient service to our customers”, said the Managing Director – CIC Life Assurance, Mr Ezekiel Owuor. The app incorporates a pension calculator, which is available for individual and salaried contributors whose employers participate in making contributions. It also includes a functionality that enables clients to invite friends to use the app. The app is currently optimised for Android phone users but plans are underway to extend the same to Apple and Windows phone users. A member using the app for the first time will need to register, then follow the prompts. Avoid becoming a victim of Fake News. Subscribe to the Standard Group SMS service by texting 'NEWS' to 22840.

The reset password will then be sent to the registered mobile phone number and email address.
