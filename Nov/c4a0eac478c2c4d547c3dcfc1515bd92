"We have four deceased individuals: police officer, two female staff employees at the hospital, and the offender," police Superintendent Eddie Johnson told journalists. The shooter killed the first victim -- a woman who was in a "domestic relationship" with him -- during an argument in the parking lot, then fired at police when they got to the hospital, and ran inside, Johnson said. Additional police -- including SWAT officers -- arrived at the scene, and "engaged the offender for several minutes in the hospital, with gunshots being fired by the offender and by the police," he said. During the shootout, the gunman killed a second woman when she got off an elevator, Johnson said. The shooter also fatally wounded, but it was unclear if he killed himself or was killed by police.
