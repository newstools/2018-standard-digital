Nakuru Police Commander Hassan Barua said the officer used his assigned G3 gun. Mr Barua said Tallam reportedly locked himself in the house before shooting his wife dead and later turned the gun on himself. “This is a patrol base that does not have an armoury. The police officer had therefore been assigned the gun for operation that he, unfortunately, used to kill his wife and himself,” said Barua. According to Barua, the killing was discovered by Tallam’s colleague at the patrol base who went to check on him yesterday morning. Avoid fake news!
