 A family from Bomet county have called for the immediate arrest of a 75-year-old man who allegedly defiled his 13- year-old granddaughter. Medical records at Siongiroi health centre confirmed that the mentally challenged minor had been defiled. According to the minor's mother from Kiproroget village in Chapalungu, the fight for justice has been frustrated by her husband who arranged for the suspect to go into hiding. “When my husband heard that I had gone to report the matter to the local chief and the police, he called his father to tell him to go into hiding and also conspired for the witness to also disappear,” she said. She claimed that her “immoral” father-in-law had sexually molested the minor on more than one occasion. “From the information I have since managed to gather from relatives and friends, my shameless father in-law has sexually molested my daughter more than once,” she said.
