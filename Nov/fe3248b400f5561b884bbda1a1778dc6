Former Machakos Senator, Johnstone Muthama has declared local mainstream newspaper journalists unwelcome to his functions, claiming their output has never been felt. Muthama, who has been publicly complaining over what he terms as ‘blatant blackout’ on the region’s news in  two leading newspapers, threatened to lead a boycott call against the companies’ products if the trend was not reversed. “These young men you are seeing here will file their stories today and the earliest they will be published is next week Friday if they are lucky,” Muthama said while addressing mourners in Tala, Machakos County. He said it was unrealistic of media houses to expect sales and advertising revenue from the region yet residents do not read any news from the region. “There has been a consistent scheme by these companies to marginalize Ukambani as if nothing good can come from here. Tomorrow you will see ‘very weak stories’ from different parts of the country as ours here go down the drain. This is completely unacceptable,” Muthama declared amid cheers from audience. He threatened to launch a campaign in the region for residents to boycott the two papers if the trend is not reversed. He said the region’s only hope in terms of news coverage remains local FM and national radio stations as well as some TV stations. Your opinion is valuable.
