Seven accused of exam malpractice out on Sh2m bond Speaking to the Saturday Standard, Mr Maina said the local security team has put measures in place to ensure men who are responsible are prosecuted. “We are waiting for conclusion of the ongoing KCSE exams before we intensify investigations,” said the DCC. He said the region’s security team is alarmed by the rising number of teenage pregnancies. Maina said early pregnancies have forced several girls to drop out of school, thus affecting performance of education in the area. The DCC banned night events which he said contributed to child pregnancies. “We have banned night discos and any traditional ceremonies that encourage sexual activities among school children. I have directed chiefs to disallow such night activities,” said the administrator.
