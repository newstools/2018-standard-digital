Mugo wa Wairimu arrested Victor Kamunya, alias Doctor Victor, and Risper Ouma were released on Tuesday after Magistrate Martha Mutuku said the prosecution failed to produce enough reason to continue holding the two. “There are no compelling reason or basis for denying the accused bail, the prosecution failed to prove that the accused are a flight risk,” Mutuku said. They were accused of operating the business at Millan Health International Limited in Kayole, Nairobi, yet they were not registered by the Kenya Pharmacy and Poisons Board. The court heard that last November 3, at the Kayole facility, they were found operating the business without authorization from the board. They faced a second count of operating a pharmacy in a premise not registered by the board. The two were also charged with operating a medical laboratory without a licence from the Kenya Medical Laboratory Technicians and Technologists Board. They were further accused of presenting themselves as doctors to Kenya Medical Practitioners and Dentists Board chief executive Daniel Yumbya.

They asked the court to release them on bail, claiming they were students and were only working at the pharmacy as interns. ALSO READ:
