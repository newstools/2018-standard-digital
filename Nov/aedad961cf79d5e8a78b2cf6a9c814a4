KCSE Candidates arrested as crackdown intensifies Speaking at Kisauni police headquarters in Mombasa County, Dr Kipsang did not, however, reveal the candidates' identities, school or county. “Students register as individuals, not regions or schools, and so we are going to deal with them in that capacity. I'm not going to mention any school or county,” said the PS. He warned candidates against smuggling materials into examinations rooms, saying if found they would be deregistered. “We ask invigilators to be thorough in their frisking to ensure unauthorised materials, including phones, do not find their way into the exams rooms. On the penalty of being found with such materials, the law is very clear; we shall recall the exam on the spot,” he said.

Kipsang assured candidates that they would not be affected by the ongoing crackdown on PSVs. ALSO READ:
