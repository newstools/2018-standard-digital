ODM leader Raila Odinga recalled how the woman leader acted as his ‘shadow MP’ during his tenure as the Langata legislator. “She would say that she was in charge when I was out of the country. “We would meet at Carnivore or Karen Blixen (coffee garden) where she would fill me in on what was happening around the constituency,” Raila said. Uhuru, a close family friend of the Kianos celebrated her selfless service to Kenyans over the years. “We remember her for the many great things that she did for this country.
