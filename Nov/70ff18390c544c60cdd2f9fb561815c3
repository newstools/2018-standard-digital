The process of licensing firearms has been riddled with corruption, incompetence and misbehaviour that has led to dancing illegal guns,” said Matiang’i. Announcing the move on Friday during the National Policing Conference held at a Nairobi Hotel, the CS said his ministry has been working on digital recording of firearms adding that the process was almost complete. “We have been working for the last few months on digital recording of firearms for the genuine holders and we shall announce when it is over. “We shall issue new certificates to the genuine holders and those without the documents will be considered to be illegally holding the firearms and you know what that means,” stated Matiang’i. He said police were conducting “comprehensive” audit of police reservists to identify those who have firearms in their possession and strip the weapons from wrong hands.
