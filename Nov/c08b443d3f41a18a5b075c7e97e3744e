Accounts about the incident varied widely throughout the early morning hours with initial reports saying the suspect was in custody. But Sheriff Dean has since said that the gunman died at the scene. Some social media accounts said a bearded man wearing a dark trenchcoat walked in and started shooting. Witnesses told CNN that patrons were there for the “College Country” night with line-dancing, music, drinks and food, and the place was packed with a young crowd. When the shots started, some people smashed windows with chairs to escape, witnesses told CNN. Other witnesses and people posting on social media said that the man might have fired up to 30 times. Others reported fewer shots, and he might have tossed smoke bombs. Officials said that shots were still being fired when the first officers arrived at the scene.
