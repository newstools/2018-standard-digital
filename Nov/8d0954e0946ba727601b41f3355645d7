SYDNEY- Sydney Airport resumed normal operations on Saturday as strong winds that caused airline chaos a day earlier eased, a spokeswoman said. Winds gusting up to 70 km per hour (44 mph) caused Sydney Airport to close one runway on Friday, leaving international and domestic travelers stranded in Australiaâ€™s most populous state.

Weather bureau meteorologist Rosemary Barr told Reuters the winds gradually eased on Saturday to up to 30 kph after a low-pressure system in the Tasman sea weakened and moved east. The winds had been part of a massive weather system over southeast Australia, that whipped up a 500 km (310 miles) dust storm on Thursday, which swept across the drought-parched interior to blanket Sydney. Sydney Airport spokeswoman Cait Tynan said the airport was operating normally on Saturday with both runways operational. Virgin and Qantas airlines put on additional flights to clear the backlog of travelers stranded by the weather. Avoid becoming a victim of Fake News.
