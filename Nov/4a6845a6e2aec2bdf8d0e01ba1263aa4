More than 200,000 residents are slated to enjoy uninterrupted power supply and free WiFi services when a Sh10 billion power project is completed. The project is a collaboration between the county government and the Kenya Electricity Transmission Company (Ketraco). Ketraco chairman James Rege visited Governor Okoth Obado before touring the areas covered by the project. Mr Rege said Sh2.4 billion would be spent on putting up electricity sub-stations in Isebania and Ndhiwa-Ongeng’ to boost power supply in the region. “Other installations towards the sub-stations will cost more money,” he said. Reduce outages Rege said the project would reduce the frequent power outages in Migori County that had interfered with the growth of industries and trade. Your opinion is valuable.

This will offer free WiFi to residents of Migori,” he said. Mr Obado welcomed the project, saying it would boost trade, industrialisation and new technology. “Ketraco is on a fact-finding mission and once they are done, the intermittent power that has been characteristic of Migori will be a thing of the past,” he said. He noted that the economic benefits arising from stable and reliable power supply were “enormous”.
