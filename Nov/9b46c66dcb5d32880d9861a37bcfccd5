A few days ago as I and my two colleagues drove to Westlands during the rush hour to an evening class, we almost hit a pedestrian. The man stood on our way unperturbed, for a moment we thought the smartly dressed guy who held a blue folder on one hand was maybe deaf and blind. We hooted but he stood still in the middle of our lane. As we maneuvered to move to the next lane, another pedestrian grabbed his hand pulling him out of the way. He quickly got back to his senses and tried to apologise to us and other angry motorists who had already started getting impatient. ALSO READ:

What could have made such a young man lose his senses in the middle of a busy road? We wondered. This week I have come across a lot of content on depression, I am now certain the young man could have been going through something that threw him off his senses. I could be wrong though. The thing about depression is that it doesn’t have a face, it sneaks in and weighs you down and before you know it, it turns you into a different being. This same week, I came across a post on social media of a certain woman who was found behind a court in Kiambu County trying to strangle her twins. Those who rescued the babies claimed the woman appeared mentally disturbed and was in urgent need of psychiatric counselling. Know if news is factual and true.
