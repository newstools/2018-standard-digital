Reuters was not immediately able to reach the suspect’s lawyer for comment, but he was quoted by Danish broadcaster DR as saying he did not wish to disclose how his client would respond to the accusations. According to anti-corruption coalition Transparency International, Denmark is one of the least corrupt countries in the world. The woman, an employee of the Danish ministry for social affairs for more than 40 years, is suspected of transferring government funds intended for vulnerable people to her own accounts between 2002 and 2018.
