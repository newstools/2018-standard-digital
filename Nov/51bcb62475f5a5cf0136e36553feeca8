Team probes pay deals for garbage “In the recent past we have seen huge heaps of uncollected garbage in the town and its environs. The issue has made it difficult for locals to conduct business,” said Mr Korir. The MCA asked Leader of Government Business Josephat Lowoi to investigate and write a comprehensive report; on why the county was no longer keen on environmental conservation. “The Public Health Act is clear that garbage should be collected and disposed of immediately. Why is our county and the department concerned not taking the matter keenly? Korir said. Huruma ward representative Peter Chomba said the fact that garbage was everywhere and no action was being taken, to address the matter, revealed that sanitation standards were falling. “Something needs to be done about the collection. It is important to note that a big area of the town is in my ward and we deserve to see the law being followed to ensure that our town is clean," said Mr Chomba. Your opinion is valuable.
