Aga Khan Hospital has been ordered to pay a former employee Sh700,000 as compensation for neglect that led to loss of a pregnancy. Labour Court Judge Mathew Nderi affirmed a magistrate court’s decision that the hospital had unfairly called Hellen Akinyi to work at its Busia medical centre while knowing that she was in pain after falling from a motorbike.

An accident “The court finds no fault whatsoever in the manner the learned magistrate applied her mind to the facts before her and arrived at the conclusion that the appellant and its doctors were negligent in the manner they handled the respondent (Akinyi), who was their employee, in her hour of need. This in itself was unfair labour practice contrary to the dictates of Article 41 of the Constitution,” ruled Justice Nderi. Aga Khan in its appeal argued that it was not to blame as Akinyi never disclosed to the doctor that she had an accident. The hospital claimed that its former cashier went to abort at Busia District Hospital without its advice. As a result of the abortion, the hospital claimed, she developed an infection and she was treated on July 31, 2013. Get live updates in Agriculture by subscribing to the new farmers TV SMS service.
