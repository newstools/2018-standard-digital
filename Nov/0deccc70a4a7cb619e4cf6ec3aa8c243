Lorries carry more containers than SGR, says report Last week, the court rejected a bid by the State and Kenya Ports Authority (KPA) challenging its jurisdiction over a constitutional application in which three people are seeking various declarations against recent radical policy shift in the management of the port following the launch of the Standard Gauge Railways freight services. The petitioners want Justices Lydia Achode, Erick Ogola, Joel Ngugi, Antony Murima and Pauline Nyamweya to determine the constitutional powers and functions of either level of government over the port under the 2010 Constitution. Petitioners William Ramogi, Asha Omar and Gerald Kiti allege that recent policies by the Government on the port, including transfer of logistical operations from Mombasa to the Embakasi-based Inland Container Deport, threaten the economy of Mombasa. Many county governments and the Council of Governors might also join the suit following an order on Friday for petitioners to invite interested parties to join through media advertisement. Interested parties were asked to join by end of November.  Stay informed while on the go by subscribing to the Standard Group SMS service. Text the word 'NEWS' to 22840.
