The Ward Development Fund Bill seeks to have each of the 20 wards allocated Sh20 million each financial year. The fund, according to the Bill, would be managed by a committee appointed by the respective MCA. County Assembly Speaker Wachira Kithanda forwarded the Bill to Ms Waiguru, but returned it with a memorandum on why she rejected it.

Waiguru also said the Bill was in contravention of the Public Finance Management Act, 2012, which provides for the establishment of such funds by the county executive member for finance. Memorandum stated "This Bill also contravenes the County Governments Act, 2012, Article 185 of the Constitution of Kenya, which distinguishes the role of a county assembly," the memorandum stated.

However, he later withdrew the allocations, accusing MCAs of misusing the funds. This made him unpopular with the ward representatives and pundits claimed it could have contributed to his removal in last year's elections.
