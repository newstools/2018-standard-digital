Two suspects nabbed over car-theft in Naivasha Kisumu County CID officer Geoffrey Kathurima said the five suspects would appear in court to face charges related to the offence committed on Tuesday night. The revenue officer is said to have colluded with the watchmen guarding the premises to sneak in a mechanic who dislodged the engine of a Toyota Prado at the yard situated at the KRA customs office next to Kamas Juakali. The Standard established that a senior KRA officer fingered in the collusion could also be interrogated over the incidence. The sports utility vehicle had been impounded about a year earlier on suspicion of having been smuggled into the country from Uganda and given a fake Kenyan number plate. Inside sources said five guards were offered Sh10, 000 each to cover the operation carried out under the cover of darkness.
