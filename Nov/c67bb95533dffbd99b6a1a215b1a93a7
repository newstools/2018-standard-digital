"We have failed to properly manage health risks at our semiconductor and LCD factories." Samsung Electronics is the world's biggest mobile phone manufacturer and chipmaker and the flagship subsidiary of the Samsung Group, by far the biggest of the family-controlled conglomerates that dominate the South's economy. Samsung currently operates vast semiconductor production compounds in Suwon as well as the cities of Hwaseong and Pyeongtaek, south of Seoul, as well as Xian in China.

Girl endures cancer pain to perform well in KCPE Hwang Sang-ki, who signed the agreement on behalf of the workers and their families, told reporters he was glad to have fulfilled his promise to his daughter, who died of leukaemia in 2007, to prove Samsung was to blame for her death.

Top performer in 2018 KCPE diagnosed with cancer "Compensation for industrial injury is important, but what's more important is prevention," said Hwang, whose story was made into a movie in 2013. Samsung has played a key part in the South's rise to become the world's 11th-largest economy, but it is also the focus of resentment over the power and influence of the chaebols and has faced accusations of murky political connections. Its de facto leader Lee Jae-yong was found guilty of bribing former president Park Geun-hye as part of the corruption scandal that brought her down, and he spent almost a year in prison before most of his convictions were overturned on appeal and he was released. The cancer scandal is one of the worst instances of industrial injuries in the South, where safety standards sometimes belie its advanced technological status. Two months ago, two subcontractors were killed in a carbon dioxide leak at Samsung Electronics' Suwon chip plant. In January, four workers suffocated due to a gas leak at a steel factory owned by Posco -- the country's top steelmaker -- in the southern city of Pohang.
