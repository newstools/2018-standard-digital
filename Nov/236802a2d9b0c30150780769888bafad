But to this date nothing tangible has been forthcoming,” said KNUN General Secretary Seth Panyako in the letter that was also copied to the Salaries and Remuneration Commission. The union is demanding that the return to work formula be implemented within 21 days. According to the agreement, the nursing service allowance was to be increased by Sh3,000 in the 2018/2019 financial year, and Sh3,500 in the 2019/2020 and 2020/2021 financial years. This would push the allowance to Sh30,000 by the year 2021 . The uniform allowance was also to be increased by Sh5,000 effective July this year. Avoid fake news!
