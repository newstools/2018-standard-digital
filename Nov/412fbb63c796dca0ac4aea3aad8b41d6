He did not say what the boat’s capacity was. Another 26 people had been rescued from the water, Onyango said, a lower figure than the initial 40 given by the police on Saturday. He attributed the discrepancy to some survivors’ failure to register with the police. “Our rescue team is still on the ground trying to rescue whoever we can find,” he said. Among those rescued on Saturday was Prince Daudi Kintu Wasajja, a brother of Ronald Mutebi, the king of Buganda kingdom, Uganda’s largest, police said. Avoid fake news!
