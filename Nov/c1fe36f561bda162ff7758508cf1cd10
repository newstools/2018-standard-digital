 Residents of Nyambene whose cattle were stolen have petitioned the Government to pay them Sh374.4 million. In a document signed by chairman Stephen Mucheke and secretary Domiziano Mwika, the locals said they had suffered enough due to continued banditry in Tigania and Igembe. According to Mr Mucheke, eight herders have been killed and more than 10,000 livestock stolen by rustlers from neighbouring counties. “A number of people have been killed and cattle stolen from us with no compensation from the Government. Only a few animals have been recovered,” Mucheke said in a statement addressed to area MPs. Herds of cattle have been stolen from Igembe Central, Tigania East and Igembe North sub-counties over the past one year. Following complaints in Parliament by Igembe Central MP Kubai Kiringo and his Tigania East counterpart Gichunge Kabeabea over the theft, Interior Chief Administrative Secretary Patrick ole Ntutu visited the area last week and assured of safety.
