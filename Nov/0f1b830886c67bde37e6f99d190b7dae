The Government, he said, had allocated close to Sh30 billion this financial year under the cash transfer programme where about 1.3 million beneficiaries will benefit. “It may be noted that since inception in 2004 to date, the Government has spent a total of Sh125.7 billion, with a significant increase between 2013 to date,” said the CS. Yatani said the new system, whose sensitisation began on Wednesday, would be rolled out after its launch in Kajiado tomorrow.
