One of the ways men are being involved in family planning is by lobbying them to accompany their spouses to clinics. Men are also being introduced to vasectomy, one of the permanent methods of family planning that has proven controversial among residents. The county government has already equipped 15 health centres with theatres and trained personnel across the county to offer vasectomy among other medical procedures. To effectively involve men, the Department of Health has recruited male community health volunteers and vasectomy champions whose role is to gather and talk to fellow men on the need to be in the forefront in family planning.

The couple however must be certain they do not want more children because it is a permanent method,” Dr Musyoki says. ALSO READ:
