Ouko reveals how MCAs steal funds In a well-choreographed scheme to fleece the taxpayer, the auditor also reveals how the National government paid the County government millions of shillings for the free maternity services at various health facilities but at the time of review, there were shortfalls resulting in an adverse service delivery. The county collected Sh10.9 billion in the year under review compared to Sh11.2 billion own source of revenue, but the audit revealed that only Sh2.4 billion representing 22 per cent of revenue collected, was banked in the County Revenue Fund. This means Sh8.5 billion was spent at the source contrary to Public Finance Management Act. The county executive budgeted to spend Sh33.5 billion, but the actual expenditure as reported in the statement was Sh24.9 billion, resulting in under expenditure of Sh8.5 billion.
