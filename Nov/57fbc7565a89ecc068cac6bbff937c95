Governor Mwangi wa Iria broke the law when he appointed chairpersons of water companies, according to the Water Service Regulatory Board. CEO Robert Gakubia (pictured) told the county assembly committee on water that the chairmen were not recognised by law. ALSO READ:

Governor's picks for water firms rejected “There are procedures on appointment of directors of boards and their chairpersons. What has been done in Murang’a is illegal and the county government has been notified that it abused the process,” said Mr Gakubia. The regulator had been invited by the county assembly to help members understand the cause of a dispute between the county government and the Murang’a Water and Sanitation Company (Muwasco), which has been raging since January. Gakubia said most companies had ignored orders that directors serve a maximum of two three-year terms. He also termed the reduced water tariffs imposed by Mr Iria early this year as unrealistic. "Water companies cannot supply water to residents free of charge. This will plunge them into financial crises. The Sh200 tariff imposed by the county government will have a negative effect on the performance of the companies,” said Gakubia. Your opinion is valuable.

It emerged that most counties had no interest in the water sector until this year. “A recent study shows that in the past, junior officers who lacked understanding of policies were deployed as directors in water firms, thus misrepresenting the interests of county governments in the management of the companies,” Gakubia said.
