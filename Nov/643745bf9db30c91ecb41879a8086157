When they saw him, he said, they flagged him down. "The officers had stopped two other tuk tuks and I could see them receive money. They saw me approach and one signaled me to stop," he said. He says he had just slowed down and wanted to stop when one of the officers hit his side mirror and smashed the windscreen. He said after stopping, he asked the officer why he had smashed his side mirror but the officer kept mum. ALSO READ:

He could not bear the pain of having his tut tuk's side mirror and windscreen smashed and he turned to the officers who were now calling for a towing car to drag his machine away. “I got annoyed and demanded to be given answers, as they tried to intimidate me, saying there was nothing I could do to them," the man said. He said he engaged the officers in a scuffle and had to fight for his rights and dignity when the officers started pulling his tuk tuk as if to make it fall to the ground. "I decided enough was enough and had to fight what I believed to be unjust and unfair cops who were intimidating me because they were in Government uniform. We exchanged blows and after I overpowered them, they picked stones and hurled at me. I had to get into my tuk tuk and try to confuse them by changing direction," he said. The man said he had been surviving on the tuk tuk business, whose proceeds he used to feed his family and educate his siblings. He said the prospect of being out of his source of his daily bread because of the policemen was too painful to fathom. "I completely lost my mind because of the injustice, which was being meted on me by police officers whose interest was the bribe," he said. ALSO READ:

He said people advised him to report the matter, but he feared he might be arrested and locked in the cells. He chose to hide. The father of one says he remains in hiding, as he feels no justice will be done to him. “A police officer is just a police officer. However wrong they were, they will always find a way to fix the case to favour them,” he said. He says the two officers should also be investigated and claims his life is in danger as reports reaching him are that a team of officers from the flying squad and Directorate of Criminal Investigations was trailing him. The Director of Public Prosecution, in a twitter post yesterday, said action should be taken against the tuk tuk driver. However, boda boda riders and motorists said the man did the right thing to teach the officers a lesson. Vincent Oraro, a rider, said police officers on the route, some in civilian wear, had been harassing them. "To say the truth, I would have done the same. The officers are concerned with bribes only and they do not even heck if we have relevant documents. The tuk tuk driver did the right thing," he said. ALSO READ:
