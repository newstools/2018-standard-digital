Nurses' Union boss Panyako charged with creating disturbance According to the council, the decision was reached after the Salaries and Remuneration Commission (SRC) cancelled a meeting with the union to discuss the way forward for the implementation of November 2, 2017 return to work formula signed between the national, county governments and Knun. The union General Secretary Seth Panyako who read a statement on behalf of the council said the agreement had factored in service allowance for nurses, which is yet to be implemented. He said the agreement was to see nurses get an increment of Sh3,000 in July this year, with additional Sh3,500 next year and a similar increment in July 2020. Yesterday, Panyako said the health practitioners have been patient enough, but were worried that the national and county governments which were party to the agreement have since abandoned it. “We want to state clearly to the public that the return to work formula has not been met and we will not lie low,” he said.

The union also registered displeasure with the SRC which has graded nurses as semi-skilled. Panyako said despite nurses’ complex duties, the SRC has been persistent in grading them as unskilled for the past three different grading. ALSO READ:
