The reforms of the past year included making registering property easier by introducing an online system to pay fees and obtain digital certificates. As a result, the time for a business to register a property transfer has been reduced to 49 days from 61 days, according to the report. Kenya strengthened access to credit by introducing a new law on secured transactions that created a unified secured transactions legal framework. It also established a new unified and notice-based collateral registry. In the getting credit area, Kenya advanced to a global rank of eight this year, from 29 the previous year.
