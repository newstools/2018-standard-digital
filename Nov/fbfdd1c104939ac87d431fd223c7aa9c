A middle-aged man charged with the defilement of a 12-year-old girl shocked a packed court room in Malindi when he pleaded guilty to the charges yesterday. When the charges were read to Kahindi Thoya who appeared before Chief Magistrate Dr Julie Oseko, the accused told the court that he indeed touched the girl, inappropriately, and wrestled her to the ground, and admitted that he intended to rape the teenager but was prevented by a crowd that rushed to the scene when the victim raised the alarm.
