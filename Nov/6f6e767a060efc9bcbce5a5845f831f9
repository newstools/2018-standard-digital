 A city-based health facility has opened a new hospital in Kathwana town. Komarock Modern Health Care Hospital opened its third branch in Kathwana. Two others are in Utawala and Komarock estates in Nairobi. The facility's Chief Executive Officer Nyamu Kamwara, who hails from Tharaka Constituency, said he opened the third branch as a way of giving back to a community that had supported him. "I decided to establish this hospital here so that our people could access services offered in far away hospitals locally," he said. The facility has a bed capacity of 180, an intensive care unit, high dependency unit with eight beds and a renal unit equipped with four modern machines that can handle 24 patients daily. Dr Kamwara said the facilities, in addition to a CT-Scan can, would enable them to offer 24-hour services without having to transfer patients elsewhere.
