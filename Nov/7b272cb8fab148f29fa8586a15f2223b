Economic pitfalls in our Devolution implementation Aukot said Kenyans were overburdened by the huge size of Government and high number of elected leaders. “The huge representation in the Government is costing taxpayers a lot. The country spends about Sh36 billion on elected officials, and this should change,” he said. To address the problem, Aukot said the number of seats should be reduced. “We want nominated slots removed and the number of constituencies reduced from the current 290 constituencies to below 147,” he said. Aukot’s party is also pushing for reduction of salaries paid for different categories of elected leaders. They want the President's salary to be capped at Sh500,000 while MPs should not earn more than Sh300,000. He is also pushing for a one-term presidency. Your opinion is valuable.
