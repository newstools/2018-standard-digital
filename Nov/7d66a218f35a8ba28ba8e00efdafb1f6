Other projects the county is planning to undertake but which have been met with protests over the alleged failure of the local authority to involve residents include upgrading the Afraha Stadium and establishing a fire station and a storm water drainage system. However, Lands Executive Francis Mwangi insisted that there had been public participation and that the projects were agreed on. "We have a very short time within which we must decide on the projects to be undertaken and start working on them. We are look at projects that will take less time, especially those that are critical but have some structures already in place," said Mr Mwangi. He added: "There was public participation where everyone was invited. However, we are still open to receive more suggestions. "I also wish to make something clear: We are not evicting anyone, as has been claimed. We only plan to utilise the open spaces between the phases to put up high-rise buildings as we seek to address the challenge of limited housing in the county. "It is unfortunate that some people are coming up to oppose some of the projects after the government succeeded in securing an investor." ALSO READ:
