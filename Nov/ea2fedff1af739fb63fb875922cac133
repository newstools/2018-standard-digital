"If we had a representative in the committee, we would not be protesting the proposals as he would present the views of our association before the final decision was made," said Mithika. “We don’t want to keep on protesting every time and this is the reason we want the minister to consider having one of ours in the implementation committee." He said this was a fight they were not ready to relent on for the sake of benefiting the local miraa farmer. “We have been registered by the relevant ministry as a sacco and we have procedures on how to give out loans to members as well as the repayment structure,” said Mithika.

Mr Mithika said they will not buy the idea of setting aside Sh30 million for digging of terraces and construction of gabions in miraa farms since this was the function of the Meru County government. He said this was a job supposed to be done by contractors making roads in all the areas in the county. ALSO READ:
