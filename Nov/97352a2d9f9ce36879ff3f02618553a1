Kariuki was happy to see Raila and the senators and said: "It is Uhuru and Raila who began the handshake. I began the process of uniting Kikuyu, Luo and all Kenyans". He recalled meeting Raila after the latter's release from prison. "Raila met me in a sauna and I remember some people running away... calling him a bad person. I sat with him and made people understand he was not bad," Kariuki said. Avoid becoming a victim of Fake News. Subscribe to the Standard Group SMS service by texting 'NEWS' to 22840.
