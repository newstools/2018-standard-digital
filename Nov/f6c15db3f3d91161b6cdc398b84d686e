Kenya Breweries Ltd has rolled out a campaign to recruit retailers of keg beer ahead of the opening of its Sh15 billion Kisumu plant. The brewer seeks to contract at least 3,000 new keg retailers in the Western Kenya region, covering 17 counties to market its low-end flagship beer – Senator Keg – to be brewed at the plant set to open soon. KBL Regional Head of Commercialism Thomas Mboya said a recruitment drive that began in March had so far registered 2,300 new outlets in the region stretching from Eldoret in Uasin Gishu County to Migori County. “Previously, we had 1,050 outlets. The initial scoping was 3,000 new outlets, but we are getting more inquiries,” said Mboya.
