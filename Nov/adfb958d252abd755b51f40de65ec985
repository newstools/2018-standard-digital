[Photo, File] A report presented before the Nyamira county assembly has revealed that the Gender department has employed 40 staff with no specific jobs, or are not allocated any duties. The revelation comes at a time the county is spending 72 per cent of its total budget on salaries alone, a situation that has seen the Controller of Budget raise the red flag. The report tabled before the House by Nominated MCA Irene Sese, showed the department was lacking employees with technical skills such as those of a deputy director in charge of administration and gender, cultural and clerical officers. It is over-staffed, with 30 support staff instead of the recommended 10. Besides over-employment, the county is also on the spot over huge expenditures that are yet to be justified. A lot of money, the report says, has been poured into building Manga Stadium but there is little to show for it. Your opinion is valuable.
