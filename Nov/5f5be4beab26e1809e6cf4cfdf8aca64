African governments have been urged to reduce taxes and other charges on the aviation industry to cushion struggling airlines.

However, he noted that it was not all doom and gloom for African aviation, with the industry expected to grow at 4.9 per cent per year in the next two decades despite the headwinds. “African air traffic is expected to double in the next 15 years courtesy of population growth and economic rates,” said Berthe. He described the single African air transport market launched in Addis Ababa in 2018 as a positive for the continent’s aviation industry. Your opinion is valuable.
