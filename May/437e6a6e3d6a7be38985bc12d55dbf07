Two people escaped death when a train from Ruiru hit their car at the Mutindwa crossing in Nairobi yesterday. The two jumped out of the car before the crash. The early morning incident happened only a few days after the same train hit a man who was walking on the railway line with earphones plugged in, in Mwiki, Kasarani, last week. ALSO READ:

Milestone in Kenya’s medical history that rescued man’s leg from amputation Witnesses said the driver of the car was attempting to cross the road that connects Umoja to Buru Buru estate. However, when the occupants saw the train approaching, they jumped out, leaving the car on the railway line. "The woman driving the car was unable to navigate the railway crossing when she heard the train hoot. The two panicked and jumped out,” said one of the witnesses. The train ploughed into the vehicle, which residents later helped to pull off the line so the train could continue its journey to the city centre.  In October 2013, 12 people died at the same spot when a train hit a matatu.
