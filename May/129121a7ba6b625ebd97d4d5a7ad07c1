An urgent private meeting was then convened for the KNUT members and police officers. A High Court in Nairobi on Thursday had temporarily stopped the replacement of Sossion soon after he was suspended. "A temporary prohibition order is hereby issued barring the respondents from registering, appointing, recognizing, putting or placing any person as Knut secretary general in place of Sossion pending the hearing of the application," the judge said.  Judge Maureen Onyango further directed the registrar of trade unions, TSC and Knut deputy SG Hesbon Otieno to file their responses before May 9 and appear for hearing on May 10. Speaking during Labour Day celebrations on May 1st 2018, Sossion said he was elected by the teachers to represent them as KNUT secretary general and nobody can remove him from office until his term comes to an end. “I am the national secretary general of the Kenya national union of teachers, duly elected by the teachers of Kenya,” said Sossion. A section of the national executive council of KNUT on April 30, had suspended Sossion during a meeting at the Kenya institute of curriculum development. ALSO READ:
