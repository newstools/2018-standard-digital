The Sarit Centre management on Thursday announced that the mall had been certified as structurally sound and it would be re-opening towards the end of next week. Business stalled and traders were left counting losses after a fire broke out on the ground floor of the mall last Friday (May 4, 2018). The building was however evacuated swiftly and no casualties were reported in relation to the incident. ALSO READ:
