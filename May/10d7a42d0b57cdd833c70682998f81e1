The MP said he was alerted about the break-in by his security guard, who was tipped off by the house help after she heard them ransacking the bedroom. He said the gang of six - who were armed with crude weapons - jumped over the fence into his compound at around 4am before breaking into the house through the rear door.

The second time they broke into my home, they got away with a television, laptop, radio system and clothes,” he said. According to Atandi, the robbers made away with similar items in yesterday’s raid. “It is unfortunate that this is the third time my home is being attacked by thugs and to date, no conclusive investigations have been done. There is no way thieves can be breaking into an MP’s house and get away with it,” he said. Atandi said he would give the police one week to investigate and arrest the suspects. ALSO READ:
