Five people were killed and at least 40 missing on the Yemeni island of Socotra on Friday as Cyclone Mekunu pummeled the area before making its way to the Arabian Peninsula’s southern coast. The dead were four Yemenis and one Indian national, residents and medical sources told Reuters, while the missing included Yemenis, Indians and Sudanese. Among those missing were three local sailors lost when their ship capsized off the coast of the island. Yemen declared a state of emergency on Thursday for Socotra, which lies between southern Yemen and the Horn of Africa and is renowned for its unique animal and plant life. Largely untouched by Yemen’s three-year-old war, it is under the control of the internationally-recognized government whose president, Abdu Rabbu Mansour Hadi, is in exile in Saudi Arabia. The storm flooded Socotra’s villages and capsized boats, leaving much of the island without access to communications. Avoid fake news!
