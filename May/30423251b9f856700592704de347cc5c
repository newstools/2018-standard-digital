A five-year-old boy burnt to death at their house in Nduga Village, Suba North sub-county. Richard Ogongo, a pupil at Bedie ECDE center, remained alone in their house yesterday when his mother went to wash clothes at a nearby pond. He did not go to school due to ill health. Area Chief Daniel Obure said a neighbour saw the fire and raised alarm, “but locals tried to save the child unsuccessfully”. His mother said there had been no fire in the house, but there was a matchbox and a gas cooker, which the boy might have attempted to light.
