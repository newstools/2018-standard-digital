Members decry use of excessive force during crackdown on hawkers Finance and Budget Committee chairman Robert Mbatia indicated that Ms Nyambura was not a certified public accountant and had no knowledge of the county’s budget-making process. “I urge that the House nullify the appointment of Mary Nyambura and find someone more suitable to handle the sensitive docket,” said Mr Mbatia. Committee vice chairman Patrick Karani said they would look for someone better versed for the finance docket. Audit queries  The Health Committee chaired by Peter Warutere found Dr Mohammed unsuitable for the position due to audit queries on the expenditure at Mama Lucy Hospital, where he is the superintendent. “The financial statements of Nairobi City County Executive for the year ended June 30, 2016, could not confirm the propriety and validity of the expenditure on goods and services amounting to Sh165.8 million,” stated the audit report. Mr Warutere further pointed out that Mohammed failed to meet the requirements of Section 7 of the Public Appointments Act. The two nominees were among 22 chief officers fronted by Governor Mike Sonko as part of his preferred team in steering development in the capital. All the other 20 chief officers were approved. They include Leboo Morintat (Public Service Management), Mude Ibrahim (Youth and Sports), Mahat Jimale (Public Health), Fredrick Nzioki (Commerce and Trade), Paul Macharia (Tourism), Stephen Mwangi (Lands), Justus Kathenge (Urban planning), Pauline Kahiga (Urban Renewal and Housing) and Jairus Musumba (Devolution). Others are Winfred Wangui (Economic Planning) and Lucia Mulwa (Education and Gender).
