A woman has been arrested with 11 kilogrammes of bhang. The bhang, with an estimated street value of Sh500, 000 was found in her house in Kiangiri village. Also impounded were 500 rolls of bhang and a bucket full of human faeces. The suspect is said to be part of an all-female bhang peddling syndicate. Kiharu assistant county commissioner Pricilla Kiluti said the arrest followed days of surveillance and public policing, admitting that security agencies had received a lot of information concerning the suspect before the arrest. “We appreciate the public for disclosing information concerning criminals and those dealing with drugs and illicit brew,” said Ms Kiluti. Security agents said they were under strict instructions to arrest suspected illicit brew and bhang peddlers. A month ago, Central Regional Commissioner Wilson Njega ordered administrators in the county to take charge in the war against drugs, illicit brews and bhang in their areas of jurisdiction.  He gave the order as he destroyed illicit liquor intercepted at licensed outlets.
