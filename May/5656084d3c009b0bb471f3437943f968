Former Yatta MP Francis Mwangangi has accused Ukambani leaders of failing to defend Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko, who has been facing criticism over his performance. "It is sad to see local leaders silent about attacks on Sonko. He has been in office for eight months only. He needs time to fulfil his manifesto," Mr Mwangangi said, claiming that Sonko’s woes had nothing to do with his performance. ALSO READ:

Sonko’s love-hate relations with Jubilee party “The criticisms are a scheme to pave the way for his ouster,” Mwangangi said during a press conference in Machakos town.

There is need for the community to now reinvent its direction in the country’s political destiny,” he said. Avoid becoming a victim of Fake News.
