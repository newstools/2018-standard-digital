First of all, I was so impressed by the Kenyan media's coverage of the foot re-implantation story at Coptic Hospital in Nairobi. It came soon after a hand was re-implanted at the Kenyatta National Hospital. One thing, though, is that more needs to be done by the media to make medics and hospitals across the nation get encouraged to give and celebrate their best. It should be noted that foot and hand re-implantation are not the only medical achievements we have realised in the medical field. ALSO READ:

Why we need to take vaccination more seriously We have a lot going on behind the closed doors of theaters, and much more in tackling lifestyle diseases like diabetes and hypertension. More has to be put out through the media to help the community know how to cope. Much is yet to be covered in communicable and non-communicable diseases, which have caused losses to the masses. I am sure the community will be empowered to live well when our brothers and sisters in the media help in sharing information on the aforementioned. Importantly so, the media has not really tackled the technical assistance that the national Government has been offering private facilities like the Coptic Hospital. I would wish that the media makes frequent contacts in Government and private facilities to get every milestone achieved, and in no time Kenya will be a haven of medical achievements.
