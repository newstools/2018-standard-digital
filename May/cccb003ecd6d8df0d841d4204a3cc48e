A one-and-a-half-day-old baby has been rescued after he was buried alive. The child's mother, a Form Two student aged about 20, was said to have buried the baby behind her mother's house in Kitare village. The baby was rescued from a shallow grave. A community health volunteer, Lea Akinyi, who had gone to visit the girl, was alarmed when the student could not explain the whereabouts of the baby. She told Ms Akinyi that the baby was dead and had been buried. Women who heard the news said it was wrong to bury the baby behind his grandmotherâ€™s house and demanded that he be exhumed and be buried in the right place. But when the 'body', which had been put in a carton, was exhumed, the women found that the infant was still alive. Avoid becoming a victim of Fake News.
