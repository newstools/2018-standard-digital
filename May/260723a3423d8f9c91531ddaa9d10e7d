Matiang'i rules out compensation for animals killed during security operations The CS told those present to ensure the guards are professional in all ways and added that only reputable organisations would be allowed to operate. PSRA is set to start its operations in two weeks, and will, among other duties, come up with regulations to guide who will be granted a permit to carry weapons. This would be a dream come true for the guards’ unions that have been asking that they be issued with the weapons. The guards will have to be trained and paid well before they are allowed to carry the weapons.
