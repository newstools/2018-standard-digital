A few days after his parents had a court hearing to get visitation of their grandson, Michael says they gave him his first written order to move out. After battling in court over the matter for some time, the Judge on Tuesday sided with his parents, ordering him out of their house in Camillus, New York, where he has been living rent-free for nearly a decade. Michael says he lost custody of his son, whose age he wouldn't disclose, back in September 2017. The boy now lives with his mother full time, who Michael says he was never married to, or in a relationship with.  He says he immediately filed an appeal as a 'poor person' so that his court fees could be waived going forward. But he says his parents complicated matters when they said he needed a job and health insurance if he was to continue living with them. He went to college, but didn't finish his degree, then started off studying engineering at Onondaga Community College, but switched to business.
