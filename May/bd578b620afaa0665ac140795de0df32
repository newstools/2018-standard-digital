The report accuses KFS of 'institutionalised corruption', saying that some of the diligent officers are constantly victimised by cartels. “The Board and Management of the Kenya Forest Service has been unable to stem and in some instances have directly participated in, abated, and systemised rampant corruption,” says the report. The team, headed by Greenbelt Movement Chair Marion Kamau, recommends that no KFS staff should be stationed in one location for more than three years. Avoid fake news!
