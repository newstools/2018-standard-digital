Karua's bribery evidence delayed The High Court in Kerugoya on Wednesday ruled against Karua’s application to have the documents filed by the court’s Registrar used as evidence. In their submission, Waiguru’s lawyers termed the move by Karua as a backdoor attempt to expand her petition despite previous rulings by the Court rejecting similar applications. The Court has also rejected Karua’s application to allow the cross examination of the Registrar as a witness in the case in what is seen as a big blow to Karua’s case. Waiguru’s lead counsel in the case, Paul Nyamodi stated that Karua’s incessant push for the introduction of new evidence signifies her desperate attempt to re-angle her arguments and change the scope of the case.  Karua’s previous application to have the presiding judge Lucy Gitari recuse herself from the case was also thrown out for lack of basis. “Karua raised the issue of bias at the Court of Appeal and failed to convince the judges and that is why this petition was referred back to this court. I was put in the dock at the Court of Appeal, tried and tested and given a clean bill of health by the three judges,” Justice Gitari said. Justice Gitari further noted that she had no interest in the case adding that Karua’s push for her recusal was a waste of time. ALSO READ:
