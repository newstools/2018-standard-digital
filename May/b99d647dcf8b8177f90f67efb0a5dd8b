Government agencies implicated in corruption are NYS, Youth Enterprise Development Fund and NCPB. “Revelations on scandals at NYS, Youth Fund and NCPB are shocking and risk retarding the development agenda of the country,” he said.

The senator said the rot at NCPB where cartels have taken over its operations has exposed the farmers to misery. He regretted that farmers have been struggling to produce crops, especially maize only for cartels to leave them counting losses. The senator explained that the strategic grain reserve initiative by the national Government was aimed at helping farmers sell their produce, but it was taken over by rogue traders who imported maize from Uganda and supplied to NCPB stores. “It is painful to see farmers toil to make a ‘kill’, and at harvest time, cartels allowed to sell their produce to NCPB leaving them struggling for market,” he said.
