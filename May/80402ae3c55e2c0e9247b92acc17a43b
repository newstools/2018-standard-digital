According to Islamic law, polyandry - a woman having more than one husband - is illegal but men are allowed to marry up to four wives. Divorce is allowed for both partners but while men can separate from their wives, the woman has to seek the husband's consent. If denied, she can go to religious court to get the approval. A news site run by the militants said Ms Abdullahi was in "perfect" health, and pleaded guilty to the charges, when she appeared in court in Sablale, 200km (125 miles) south-west of Mogadishu. Divorces are common in Somalia but the details of this case are unusual, the BBC Somali Service's Mowliid Haji Abdi says. ALSO READ:
