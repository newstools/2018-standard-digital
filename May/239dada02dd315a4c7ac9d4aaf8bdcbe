The regulations require all SIM-cards to be registered prior to activation. “We wish to remind subscribers that part of the regulation provides that a person who intends to register a SIM-card shall provide full names, identity card, date of birth, physical address, postal address among other particulars,” said Francis Wangusi, Director General Communications Authority. Subscribers whose SIM-Cards will be suspended may be reactivated upon submission of relevant information to their service provider,” he said.  Ahead of last year’s general election, the Communications Authority enforced tough penalties on unregistered SIM-Cards in a move that was aimed at to tame misuse of mobile phones in the country. Under the guidelines by then, the Authority said one is eligible to a fine of Sh100, 000 or six months in jail if one uses a sim card that is not registered. Other offenses attracting similar penalty include buying sim cards from hawkers and failure to report a lost sim card to a police station. ALSO READ:
