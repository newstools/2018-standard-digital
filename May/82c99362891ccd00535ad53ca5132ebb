Radical change to ODM nomination rules proposed Sifuna said he was privy to information that funds for political parties were not factored in the 2018/19 budget under the Political Parties Fund. He said lack of funding has made it hard for the political outfits to run their affairs effectively. “The National Treasury is not remitting any cash to the party and this has impacted negatively to our activities,” Sifuna said. He defended ODM leader Raila Odinga over claims that he was reluctant to comment on the latest National Youth Service (NYS) scandal.  He said the party has urged investigative agencies to move with speed and get to the bottom of the matter so that those implicated in the scam can be charged in court. “I am the spokesperson of the party and when I speak I have the blessings of my party leader. However, the war against corruption must be fought by all Kenyans not one individual,” Sifuna said. Busia ODM secretary Innocent Oluku said the party will start filling positions left vacant after last year’s elections. ALSO READ:
