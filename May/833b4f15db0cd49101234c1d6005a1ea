Elgeyo Marakwet: The Keiyo community has petitioned President Uhuru Kenyatta to help put an end to land grabbing and other injustices meted to locals. The community, represented in the appeal by the Kokwetab Keiyo lobby group, congregated at the historic Kamariny grounds in Iten at the weekend and issued a 14-day ultimatum to those who have grabbed land locally to return the same, failure to which they will conduct traditional rituals to curse them.

He alleged that some of the said parcels of land, which had been earmarked for development, are now under private ownership.
