Inside the holiday village run by spies The Sharia (Islamic religious law) court convicted Ms Hussein of premeditated murder last month and on Thursday officially sentenced her to death by hanging, according to Reuters news agency. Her lawyers have 15 days to appeal. "Under Sharia law, the husband's family can demand either monetary compensation or death," Badr Eldin Salah, an activist from the Afrika Youth Movement who was in the court told the agency. "They chose death and now the death penalty has been handed down." Yasmeen Hassan of Equality Now, one of the groups seeking to have the conviction overturned, told BBC News the verdict had not surprised her. "Sudan is an extremely patriarchal place and gender norms are very strongly enforced," she said. "It is a place where girls are allowed to be married at age 10, there's legal guardianship of men over women, women are told you have to walk a straight and narrow line and don't transgress. "To Noura's credit, she is a feisty girl, she is a girl who wanted her education and wanted to do good in the world and she has been trapped in the situation and is now a victim of this system."

"Noura Hussein is a victim and the sentence against her is an intolerable act of cruelty," said Amnesty representative Seif Magango. "The Sudanese authorities must quash this grossly unfair sentence and ensure that Noura gets a fair retrial that takes into account her mitigating circumstances."
