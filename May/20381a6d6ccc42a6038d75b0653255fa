President Uhuru Kenyatta  has no option but to come out publicly to confirm that he will back his Deputy William Ruto for the presidency in 2022. This is important because at the moment, enemies of the Jubilee Party are taking advantage of his silence and want to drive a wedge between the two leaders. To be candid to the Head of State, the only political legacy he can leave is that of ensuring a united Jubilee Party, yet that can only be achieved if he backs Ruto. Just to remind us, DP Ruto dissolved his United Republican Party (URP) that had members across the country to make JP. It is therefore proper for his boss to stand with him at this time when people expect him (Uhuru) to be closest to Ruto. ALSO READ:

Apologies will not put food on tables As a Jubilee MP from Western Kenya, I can say without fear or favour that President Kenyatta got votes from the region because of his deputy. A lot of people voted for the Jubilee party knowing that Ruto would automatically take over in 2022 with the blessings of his party leader. President Uhuru must assure them of this. The President has a golden chance to come out and pronounce himself in this serious matter for him to be different from some of the party leaders who have the history of burning bridges. At the same time, he needs to explain to Kenyans and his supporters that the recent handshake between him and Raila has nothing to do with the 2022 succession politics, and that he has not endorsed the Opposition chief for anything superior to what Ruto deserves.
