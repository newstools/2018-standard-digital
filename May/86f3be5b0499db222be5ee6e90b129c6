Roba said the community still favours men. “I have dozens of requests for jobs in Mandera County for men and almost none for women,” Roba said. The Constitution stipulates that women should take at least 30 per cent of government jobs. The county has advertised a number of vacancies, including board membership at Mandera Water and Sewerage Company and a number of managers.
