Bobasi MP Innocent Obiri appeared in a Kisii court charged with incitement and damage to property. The MP appeared before Resident Magistrate Julius Mutai for breach of peace, contrary to section 95(1) (b) of the penal code. He was charged that on May 6, at Getanga sub-location in Sameta sub-county within Kisii County, without authority, the legislator entered County 45 Investment Limited Quarry and thereafter blocked the entrance, thereby creating disturbance. He later appeared before Kisii Senior Resident Magistrate Ezekiel Obina charged with incitement to violence. The charge sheet read that on May 6, 2018, while at Masongo in Kisii County, and without lawful excuse, the MP uttered words meant to incite local residents against quarry workers. In the first case, Obiri, who was represented by lawyer Okongo Omogeni, was released on a cash bail of Sh100,000. The case will be mentioned on May 25, while hearing date was set for June 29.  In the second case, the magistrate released the legislator on a cash bail of Sh50,000 with a similar surety. Obiriâ€™s bodyguard Charles Nyakweba was also charged at the Ogembo law courts for assault and malicious damage to property. He denied the two counts and was released on a cash bail of Sh100,000.
