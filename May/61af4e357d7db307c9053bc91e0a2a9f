Jitters continue to arise from a section of Jubilee members that Raila may be plotting to use the unity pact as a reason to win Uhuru's endorsement in 2022. Washiali said it was up to the President to act diligently so that the working together doesn’t break the unity in the ruling party.  Washiali said Raila has had a bad history with working with other parties that has seen those parties fall. “Raila has worked with other parties in the past but after a short time those parties crumbled and we hope it won’t be the same,” said Washiali.
