NAIROBI, KENYA: A law proposed by Kenya’s Finance Ministry aimed at regulating the financial sector will emasculate the central bank, and fails to address a cap on commercial lending rates, the bank’s governor said on Tuesday.

It says digital lenders will be licensed by a new Financial Markets Conduct Authority and bound by any interest rate caps the Authority sets. ALSO READ:

The bill did not propose repealing the government’s cap on commercial lending rates, which local banks and the International Monetary Fund blame for sluggish growth in private-sector credit. Njoroge also said lower fiscal deficit targets set by authorities would be challenging to meet, but if they were achieved it would create room for monetary easing. Know if news is factual and true.
