Why ghosts of Bomas draft haunt Kenyans The intervention of the Nyanza Council of Church Leaders comes amid ceaseless wrangles rocking the council, even after attempts by NASA leader Raila Odinga to broker peace. Led by Archbishop Washington Ngede and Bishop William Abuka of the Faith Community Fellowship, the church leaders said they will not stop until the elders are united. “We have embarked on a week-long prayer and fasting mission to seek divine power as we move to reconcile the elders whose roles are key in uniting the Luo community,” said Washington Ngede of the Faith Community Fellowship. Archbishop Ngede told Sunday Standard that the wrangles are not good for members of the community who rely on the council of elders for wisdom.  The council is divided into two factions, one led by Opiyo Otondi and the other by Nyandiko Ongadi. Both of them claim to be the legitimate chair of the council. Attempts by Opposition leader Raila Odinga to resolve the wrangles last month bore no fruits. In the meeting, Raila implored on Ongadi’s faction to support Otondi. “We are not happy with some of the elders and we want to pray for them to rise above the division and work as a team for the common good of the Luo,” said Ngede. The church men want the elders to reconcile and work as a team to help unite the community and join councils from other parts of Kenya in rebuilding the country after last year’s divisive elections.
