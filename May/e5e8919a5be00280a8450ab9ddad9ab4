In response, she said not all children are covered while breastfeeding. She then asked the waitress if she wanted her to breastfeed in the toilet. The information was distorted,” said Ms Gichuki, adding that the customer was served four minutes after placing her order. Martin Njiru, the restaurant’s legal adviser, said they had tried reaching out to Kim to no avail. Her claims led to street demonstrations by a group of women.
