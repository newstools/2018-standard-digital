 First of all, there are fears Â of a referendum even before the 14-member advisory team has identified areas to address as directed by President Uhuru Kenyatta and Opposition leader Raila Odinga. But that should not be the case. ALSO READ:

EU pledges to support Big Four agenda I have seen the Jubilee faction of Aden Duale and Kipchumba Murkomen express fear that the union between the president and the opposition chief that has brought the referendum debate stands to split Jubilee. I cannot be certain that the party will split, but if the referendum drive is backed by a majority of Kenyans, President Uhuru and a section of Jubilee leaders, and the Duale team takes the selfish move of opposing it, then Jubilee will collapse. JP may succumb due to unnecessary fear and panic. Nonetheless, at this point I would like to appeal to all politicians and political parties to find a common ground as the 14-member committee works on the assignment meant to have an inclusive country. We will then discuss what the advisory team brings to the national table and chart the way forward. If the recommendations will include a change of the Constitution to have an accommodative Executive and Kenyans back it, well and good-the Constitution belongs to Kenyans. The referendum debate should not be the cause of a political party breakage, as a few politicians want to project. Let Kenyans remain steadfast in ensuring we have an inclusive country where whoever is in power enjoys goodwill from a broader mass as has been the case with past regimes.
