Matatu operators on the Mwiki route have held demonstrations against a sacco inspectors for killing a tout found to have overcharged passengers. Julius Kamau was beaten on April 23, by inspectors of Mwiki Sacco Limited (MSL) buses plying Mwiki-city centre route. Winfred Kimanzi said her husband told her he had charged passengers Sh100, as opposed to the usual Sh80, to get them to Mwiki and not Maternity stage, where most matatus turn due to ongoing road construction. However, when inspectors belonging to MSL bordered the matatu, they said passengers had been overcharged. Mrs Kimanzi said the inspectors beat up Kamau, injuring him on the head and body. “My husband arrived at 2am that day and asked if I could see how he had been hurt... I saw his mouth, it was swollen. His head was injured,” said Kimanzi.  Kamau was later that night admitted to Kiambu District Hospital, but his condition worsened. The widow suspects Kamau died due to internal injuries. The family is relying on the findings of the postmortem examination conducted yesterday to file a case against Kamau’s attackers. Some motorists on the route, while being interviewed by a local media, confirmed that cases of excessive use of force by the inspectors against perceived ‘weak’ or ‘poor’ matatu operators were common. MSL chairperson Simon Karangu said the sacco has never directed its inspectors to use force on its employees. Passengers were left stranded during yesterday’s protest, with some walking four kilometres to the Thika Superhighway to board matatus plying other routes. Matatus belonging to other saccos took advantage of the situation, charging at least Sh200 to the central business district.
