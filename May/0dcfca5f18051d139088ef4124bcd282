The exercise comes barely three years after a similar audit revealed that the county had been losing Sh29 million every year to ghost workers. According to the report sanctioned by former County Secretary Humphrey Nakitari, eight departments were affected, with the staff involved earning salaries of between Sh20, 633 and Sh246, 947. The report, however, could not ascertain the individuals who had been withdrawing the monies from the ghost workers’ accounts. But Charles Opiyo, chairman of the Kenya County Government Workers Union Nyanza Chapter, expressed reservations about the planned head count, saying the union was not involved in planning the exercise.
