The deceased is suspected to have been murdered in Jogoo’s house before the body was dragged outside. “Blood stains were traced to Jogoo’s house,” claimed Andrrew Nanjiaya a neighbour. The suspect was allegedly with the deceased in a drinking spree on Thursday night. Jogoo was on the run for the better part of Friday after the police picked the body and narrowed down on him as the prime suspect. He showed up later in the evening and was spotted at his father’s house.  Villagers mobbed him before police officers came to his rescue. He is in custody at Shianda police post. “We saw him trying to jump through the window before he was cornered by the villagers,” said Nanjiaya. Relatives suspect Nanjira was killed after a row over Sh2,000 he had earned from doing casual jobs. The residents torched the suspect’s house. The area police boss Peter Kattam warned them against taking the law into their hands.  ALSO READ:
