"We have resolved that the strike must continue because our demands have not been met," said George Omondi, the secretary general of the University of Nairobi's UASU Chapter. In addition to a counter-offer to their 2017-2021 collective bargaining agreement, UASU and KMPDU have demanded the payment of clinical allowances to teaching staff, whom they said had not received the money for 17 months despite performing the same tasks as doctors. The unions also demanded better working conditions for doctors and teaching staff. The unions also claimed that medical students, who are currently missing classes because of the strike, were in favour of the strike.
