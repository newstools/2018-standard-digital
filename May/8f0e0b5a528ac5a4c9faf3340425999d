The 280-metre street at Makutano is being paved with cobblestones in readiness for the rolling out of works in various parts of the county. The pilot road is expected to be ready in the next two weeks. The institute will train graduates from the Youth Service camp in Meru to pave the roads. “Paving roads with cobblestones is labour-intensive, so the aim is to deploy the Youth Service in doing the works, which will also earn them income,” said the executive.

Our streets and market areas will be dust and mud-free for long periods because roads built with cobblestones have been found to be long-lasting,” Taitumu added.
