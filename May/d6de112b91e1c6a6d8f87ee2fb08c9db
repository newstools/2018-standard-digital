A swimming spree turned tragic on Saturday evening after two children died in a quarry in Nyahururu. The two aged 12 and 10 respectively were swimming at Kichinjio quarry when they drowned. According to residents, theyÂ had been accompanied by a sister aged four years as they went for swimming. "The sister was left with their clothes as they went to swim. It was after a while that she went to report home that the two were still in the water," said Bob Muriuki, a resident. He noted that the locals were later informed of the incident and visited the scene. Officers from the Nyahururu Police Station also visited the scene to try and rescue the two children.
