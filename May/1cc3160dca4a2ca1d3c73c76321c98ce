In her application, she argued that the magistrate gave her an excessive sentence. She also said the prison was not a safe place for her to raise her children. And yesterday, Justice Dorcas Chepkwony ordered a probation officer to visit the village and file a report on whether Mwaka was of good conduct and whether she would co-operate with the court if granted bond. In the report, the probation officer is expected to state whether villagers will accept Mwaka back in view of several claims against her.

While applying for bond, Mwaka said she had a high chance of succeeding in her appeal.
