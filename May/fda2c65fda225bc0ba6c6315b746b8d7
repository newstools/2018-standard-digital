Man killed over Sh100 debt Thiari, the court explained, would now be required to defend himself against allegations of murdering his mother on July 27, 2014 at their home in Kaini Village, Mukurwe-ini. Ngaah said the substance of the charge had been explained to the accused. The judge said Thiari has a right to give evidence on oath from the witness box. If he decides to take the witness box, Thiari will be cross examined by both the prosecution and defence. State counsel Festus Njue had pleaded with the court to put Thiari on his defence. Njue said witness accounts placed Thiari at the scene of murder.  “Circumstantially, testimonies adduced in court have put the accused at the epicentre of the crime scene and therefore, we pray the accused be put on his defence,” he said. Thiari’s lawyer Kimani Njuguna declined to make any submissions during yesterday’s session.
