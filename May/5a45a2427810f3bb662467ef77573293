Mr Odero Ojwang’, a Chemistry teacher at Usenge High School, said gas cylinders stored under high temperatures can explode. “When there is some leakage, the gas combines with all air molecules and causes fire,” said Mr Ojwang’, adding that when a jiko is used near a gas cylinder, chances of the latter exploding are high. He said: “Most of the cooking gas involved in explosion always lacks Ethyl Mercaptan, a chemical that gives a smell that enables detection of leakage by users.”
