US threatens to slash research agency’s funding Research conducted at the Jaramogi Oginga Odinga Teaching and Referral Hospital showed that the drug, which is commonly used to treat parasitic infections, was effective against mosquitoes. “Through the study, we found out that the moment somebody takes Ivermectin, if a mosquito bites them, they actually become poisonous to that mosquito. So if a mosquito bites you after taking Ivermectin, that mosquito dies," said Mr Kariuki. A randomised trial published in The Lancet Infectious Diseases shows that multiple, high doses of the drug are well tolerated and able to kill mosquitoes biting humans for at least 28 days after treatment. Kariuki said Ivermectin is one of several measures - including use of treated mosquito nets and spraying houses - that could be used to reduce malaria through mass administration in a community or village.
