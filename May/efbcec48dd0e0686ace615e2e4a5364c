He said that Bayt-ul-Maal group has commenced gathering signatures to petition Kenyan Muslims scholars to deliberate and craft a modern day Bayt-ul-Maal (Islamic Treasury) catering for the needs of Muslims. The group has commenced collecting signatures at the beginning of the holy month of Ramadhan. They embarked on a door-door campaign sensitizing the Muslims community on the importance of Bayt-ul-Maal.  The group claims that since February, this year, debate has raged concerning the validity, in Sharia’h terms, of Islamic banking and Sharia'h Compliant windows, as offered by some conventional banks.  The debate has been bolstered by the rulings of five eminent scholars seeking to find real solutions to the problem of interest (Riba) which is strictly prohibited in Islam.
