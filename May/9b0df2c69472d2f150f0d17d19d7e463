ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi has challenged the Jubilee government to resign over the current spate of scandals. "What is happening is no longer the usual corruption that is endemic in Government, but planned looting of public resources by those entrusted with its protection," he said in a statement yesterday.

In open democratic societies, at the scent of such a monumental rip-off, this Government would have resigned by now." Mudavadi said the massive theft in the Ministry of Health, National Youth Service, Kenya Pipeline Company, National Cereals and Produce Board and Youth Enterprise Fund, shows departments in Government were formed for purposes of stealing. “The only new thing is the thieves' confidence. It's like they know the law can't reach them. That's why they steal with impunity," he said.
