Miraa farmers and traders have announced plans to march today in Maua town to protest at the delay in utilising Sh2.2 billion Treasury allocated to the sub-sector. The Nyambene Miraa Traders Association (Nyamita) said in Meru town that it was disappointed the allocations done in two batches of Sh1 billion in the 2016/17 and Sh1.2 billion in the 2017/18 financial years had been lying idle at the Treasury.
