The Anti-Counterfeit Agency (ACA) has seized consignments of counterfeit products worth Sh25 million in an operation in Nairobiâ€™s transit deport. Deputy Director for Enforcement and Legal Service John Adera said four suspects were arrested and are being questioned. Police officers attached to the agency and enforcement officers confiscated the goods as they were being transported in five containers from Mombasa port to an unknown destination. Trade Cabinet Secretary Adan Mohammed said they will step up the war against counterfeit products and extend it to places of origin of goods.
