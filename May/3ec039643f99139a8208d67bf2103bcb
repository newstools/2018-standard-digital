We have said that the two should proceed with their hunting mission,” said Kibwana. “It is not for us to discourage budding leaders to shelve their ambitions because it is possible for them to eventually succeed. As the party chairman of Wiper, I have consulted with Kalonzo and resolved to end all political conflicts,” he added. There has been open political rivalry and bad blood between the former vice president and the Machakos governor after the latter fell out with the former and went ahead to chart his own political path outside Wiper. Differences escalated  Kalonzo and Mutua’s differences escalated in the run-up to last year’s General Election when the Wiper party leader backed Mutua’s rival, former Kathiani MP Wavinya Ndeti in the governorship race. Mutua successfully defended his seat. Mutua then threw his support behind President Uhuru Kenyatta’s re-election against Opposition leader Raila Odinga, whose running mate was Kalonzo. During Saturday’s event, Mutua and Kibwana staged a ‘political handshake’ before a huge crowd and pledged to open a new chapter of forging political, economic and social unity. ALSO READ:
