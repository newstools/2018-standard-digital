The wheel was said to have come loose as pressure built up in the tyre, hitting the three men, who were monitoring the process. Two of them died on the spot while the third one was rushed to hospital with a fractured skull. “I was just here where I fry fish when I heard an explosion and saw two people tossed into the air,” said Elizabeth Oginga, who runs a shop just metres from the welding shop.

She said she saw the wheel soar and hit an electricity line before tearing into one of the tin-roofed shops. “We took off in panic as the men fell back on the ground,” she said, adding that both had deep skull fractures and broken limbs. The welder was identified as Peter Ogot, the lorry driver as George Ouma, and the survivor as Everest Okoth. Ms Oginga said she heard one of the men warn that the tyre was overinflated, but his concerns were dismissed just before the explosion. ALSO READ:
