Raila not genuine in unity call: Ruto Speaking at his Kanduyi home at the weekend, Mr Wetang'ula said while he was not opposed to changes in the Constitution, the timing was suspect and inappropriate. He said the country should instead start making amendments to issues that directly affected citizens as opposed to those that would require a referendum. “We are not opposed to the changes but let’s not start the changes from the top; let's start with the changes that don’t require a referendum,” he said. Devolved funds  He cited issues such as minimum allocation of devolved funds, which he said should be raised from 15 per cent to 45 per cent. "That would directly help people and doesn’t require a referendum," he said. Other issues he said could be addressed in the Constitution without necessarily voting included police reforms, judicial independence and strengthening of devolution structures. Wetang’ula said it was unfortunate that politicians wanted to use the referendum debate to put the country in an election mood again. ALSO READ:
