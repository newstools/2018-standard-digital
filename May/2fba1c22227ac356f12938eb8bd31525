World Bank urges pension schemes to invest in infrastructure "The Agriculture ministry has confirmed to me that it already received the funds and farmers will be paid beginning Monday. I also want to apologise to farmers for the delay. This should not have happened because we did not expect an over-supply of maize by farmers," said Mr Rotich. The CS was speaking at the burial of Major (rtd) Charles Chesire in Kaptuli on Saturday. Mr Chesire was the Central Rift Athletics Kenya vice-chairperson. The announcement comes as a reprieve for thousands of farmers who have been protesting over delayed payments. Two weeks ago, Parliament approved Sh1 billion towards settling the debt, but there were questions why the money had not reached the farmers.  Earlier, leaders put the national government on the spot for exposing farmers to suffering by failing to pay them on time. Moiben MP Silas Tiren called for investigations into cartels that have allegedly been importing maize, flooding the market and lowering prices.  ALSO READ:
