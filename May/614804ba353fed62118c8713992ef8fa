Speaking at the St Francis Chaptarit Catholic Church, Mosoriot, Nandi County, on Sunday, Ruto said dishonest leaders were a threat to democracy and unity of the country. “The biggest threat to our democracy, our progress, and stability are people who have questionable democratic credentials; dictators who participate in elections, and yet they do not accept the outcome of any election,” said Ruto. Ruto was accompanied by Lands Cabinet Secretary Farida Karoney, Nandi Governor Stephen Sang, Senator Kiprotich Cherargei and MPs Wilson Kogo (Chesumei), John Waluke (Sirisia), Tecla Tum (Nandi), Kimani Ichungwa (Kikuyu), Cornelly Serem (Aldai) and Julius Melly (Tinderet).  The Deputy President said Kenyans do not need the help of “other people” to make the Jubilee Administration a “legitimate Government” because they did it during the last General Election.
