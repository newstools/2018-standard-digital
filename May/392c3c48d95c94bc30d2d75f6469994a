The main suspect in the first case is said to have been angered by a village council decision that he should do 100 sit-ups and pay a $750 fine for raping the girl, and attacked the girl's parents and set their house on fire with the teenager inside. The two cases have shone a spotlight on the treatment of rape in India, where some 40,000 cases were reported in 2016. The country had already been agonising over the brutal gang-rape and killing of an eight-year-old girl in Jammu and Kashmir State, which is to be raised in the Supreme Court on Tuesday. Eight Hindus have been accused over the abduction, repeated rape and killing of the Muslim girl. ALSO READ:

As many as 578 rape cases were reported up to April 15, against 563 in 2017 during the same period, police said.
