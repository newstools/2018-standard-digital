Eight Coca Cola employees have been arrested in Kisii for selling expired products at Kisii Town's Daraja Mbili Market. Kisii Town Public Health Officer Silvia Kerubo said that they have been trailing the suspects for a whole week. The eight were caught on Thursday morning with four pick-ups full of plastic sodas. "We got information that Cola Cola have been selling soda at half price which raised some suspicion. We are always aware when the company carries out a promotion but this shocked even the locals," said Silvia. According to Silvia, a total of 3,500 bottles were impounded with more already having gone to the market. "Cap 254 of the Public Health Act is clear on products that should be sold and safety of food. They have raided the market for a whole week and we need to inform residents to remain extra careful."
