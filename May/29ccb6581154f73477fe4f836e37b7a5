On noticing the anomaly, Ms Kanari wrote to the ousted Youth Ministry PS Lilian Omollo on December 23, 2016 informing her of the deposit and asking for a reversal of funds. It is not clear whether the PS responded. The PS has declined to comment on this but in the email, Ms Kanari wrote: “I refer to the attached payment confirmation Ref FT1635557CKV and hereby confirm it has been sent to us erroneously.” “Kindly note that I have given my bank instructions for the monies to be returned to account 1000303301. I will forward the confirmation slip once I receive it,” she told the PS. The designer says she did not tender or supply any goods for the money in question. ALSO READ:

Punish graft suspects, Gideon tells President “I was surprised to get money in my account, a whole Sh15 million and when I asked my bank, they told me it had been sent from Central Bank,” she says. “On further inquiry, I discovered it had been sent from the NYS and I felt the good thing is to ask the bank to re-wire the money back to where it came from. I even wrote to the PS about this,” she says. On the same day she informed the PS of the mysterious payment, NIC wired back the money to CBK through transmission reference number FT163585J4QTW. It was then remitted to the NYS. “As I promised, find attached a copy of the confirmation of the swift transfer. This is to confirm that the monies sent to us erroneously of Sh15,306,689.00 has been returned to the Central Bank account number 1000303301 on December 23, 2016,” wrote Kanari to the PS. “After that is the swift bank confirmation to prove the same,” she said. The matter rested until Occasions and Days Ltd’s name appeared last week in the list of companies that received the Sh9 billion that has been lost at NYS. It did not even end there.
