Prisoner found guilty of killing inmates for refusing to sing 'Hallelujah' Kenyenya sub-county OCPD Isaac Thuranira said Mr Karori was reportedly given Sh1,000 to share with his co-workers, among them the suspect whom he allegedly owed Sh100 of the money. The suspect is said to have slashed Karori on the neck, killing him on the spot before fleeing from the scene. The villagers in turn razed the suspect’s house and vowed to lynch him if he was found. Karori’s mother, Mary Osebe, said she could not understand why the suspect killed her son over Sh100 when the family was willing to pay it.  “We suspect that my son may have been killed for other reasons,” said Ms Osebe.
