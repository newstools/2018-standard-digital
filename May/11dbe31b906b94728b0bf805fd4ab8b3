Karua on tight spot over evidence on election petition She argued that it was not necessary to have an affidavit sworn and filed by the said informer since it is the prerogative of IEBC to conduct credible elections. Karua was speaking during cross examination by Andrew Muchiri, one of the lawyers representing Kirinyaga Governor Anne Waiguru. Muchiri told the court the disclosure of the name of the petitioner’s informer and filling of a supportive affidavit to enable him cross examine the witness would greatly assist the court in unearthing the truth regarding the allegations. Karua also told High Court Judge Lucy Gitari the gubernatorial elections were fraudulent.  She cited the opening of a ballot box in the absence of relevant parties outside Wanguru tallying centre by an IEBC official in the full glare of the cameras. Hearing of the petition continues with lawyers for Waiguru expected to complete their cross-examination of Karua. The petitioner has lined up 14 witnesses.  ALSO READ:
