There is nothing like Gema business community,” said Gema chairman Kimani Rugendo. Last Friday, Raila met a group claiming to be leaders of Gema business community in Nairobi where they agreed to work together in reconciliation efforts. The two-hour closed door meeting was punctuated with cheers and claps however the former Prime Minister did not address the media but allowed the “Gema” officials, Ruaraka MP Tom Kajwang and his Nyando MP Jared Okello to brief journalists on the deliberations. Gema business community chairperson Wilfred Kamau said they had resolved their differences with the opposition leader and hinted at the possibility of supporting the referendum “if that is what will heal the country.” Raila has committed himself to building bridges. Time will come when 2022 politics will be discussed,” said Mr Kamau. Know if news is factual and true. Text 'NEWS' to 22840 and always receive verified news updates.
