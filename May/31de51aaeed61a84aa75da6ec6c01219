Martha Karua’s sister Loise Wanja on Tuesday gave a contradicting testimony to the affidavit filed by the Narc Kenya leader. In her testimony, Wanja noted that Karua’s agents were barred from polling stations for lack of Narc Kenya accreditations which were to be issued by Ms. Karua, differing with the Narc Kenya leader’s claims that her agents were locked out of the polling stations for lack of IEBC accreditation.

Records also show that Karua’s agents actually reported to the polling stations and signed in, some as early as 4am, two hours before voting began. During a cross-examination by IEBC lawyer John Kathungu last week, Karua claimed that she could not remember whether or not the flash disc, which she had earlier claimed it went missing, was filed as evidence. Records also showed that the flash disc was not listed in the receipt showing evidence submitted to the registrar by Karua. Avoid becoming a victim of Fake News.
