Schools have been asked to ensure toilets and latrines are safe for use by teachers and students. Nakuru Public Health Officer Samuel King’ori said his office has dispatched officers to sub-counties to inspect sanitation facilities. This came after three primary schools, one in Nakuru and two in Rongai, were forced to close down indefinitely after pit latrines collapsed due to the heavy rains currently pounding the area.

Education Ministry declines to register informal schools in Kisumu “Teachers should help in inspecting schools and advise relevant authorities because we do not want to endanger any life,” said King’ori. The county has 1,070 public primary schools and Early Childhood Development Education (ECDE) centres and King’ori said all of them will be inspected. On Tuesday, six pupils at Kisulisuli Primary School escaped death when a pit latrine caved in with them. Four pupils escaped unhurt while two sustained injuries and were rushed to Nakuru Level Five Hospital. “School managements should assess structures in their respective schools, especially during this rainy season to avoid disasters,” said King’ori. He said most schools in the county have inadequate sanitation facilities compared to enrollment of learners, posing a danger of diarrhoea and pneumonia outbreak. “The management and education stakeholders should find a solution,” he said.
