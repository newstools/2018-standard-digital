Christianity is a concept that demands  mankind emulates the deeds of Jesus Christ. More importantly, it is about compassion, doing good and humility. Everywhere Jesus went, he preached peace, healed the sick and assisted widows and orphans. These are not values you will find in the present-day church, particularly those churches that advertise themselves under some improbable names; those churches that proclaim miracles they cook up. (These are) the churches that will set up posters everywhere and the only thing you can read from a mile away is the M-Pesa paybill number. ALSO READ:

Pope Francis and the future of christianity I have issues with churches whose pastors do things that would make one's blood crawl. There are some churches that do things we can't openly state here because they are too embarrassing. Sadly, some of the crazy things that happen in church and that must annoy God no end happen mostly in Nigeria, South Africa and Kenya. When some pastors tell congregants to drink motor oil or eat live snakes, you know something is seriously wrong. Only an unstable mind would revel in such eccentricity. Clearly, rather than be in charge of a flock that is itself confused to be fooled thus, these quack pastors should be made to seek medical help. These fellows are extremely dangerous and only end up corrupting the moral values of a society.  Mr Achala is a businessman in Eldoret Avoid fake news!
