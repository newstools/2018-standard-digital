We have enough schools, says MP The ceremony was briefly interrupted as the MP’s aides lifted him to his vehicle before rushing him to Bondo Medical Centre. The Sunday Standard team found doctors at the facility transferring him to an ambulance for referral to Aga Khan hospital in Kisumu shortly after 4pm. At Aga Khan hospital, Amollo’s aides rushed him in through the back door, probably to avoid a battery of journalists who had camped at the facility. Dr Julius Okel said the MP was out of danger and responding well to treatment, adding that he could have suffered exhaustion. Mr  Amollo’s wife Linet also assured his supporters that the MP was well. “Actually my husband is now in good mood and we thank God for his doctors,” Linet said.
