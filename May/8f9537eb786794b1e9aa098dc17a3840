The association wants the court to grant conservatory orders stopping implementation of the Kiambu County Alcoholic Control Act 2018, terming it unlawful. In suit documents filed in court and seen by The Standard, Kagiri argues that the new law is illegal because it is yet to be published in the Kenya Gazette and Kiambu County Gazette. In a replying affidavit sworn by County Secretary Martin Njogu, the county government defended the new law, saying it was meant for public good.  Justice Christine Meoli will give a ruling on June 29 on whether the bar owners will be granted conservatory orders or not.
