I have confidence in the team and I know they have performed beyond expectations,” said Mr Sifuna. Asked if the team have issued a preliminary report, Sifuna said there was no need since the mandate and timelines for the task force were limited. Members of the taskforce are Catherine Mumma (chairperson), Larry Gumbe, Irshad Sumra, Alfelt Gunda and Tony Moturi.
