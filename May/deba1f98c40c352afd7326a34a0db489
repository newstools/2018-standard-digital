Peter Kamau and his family are among those who have resisted moving, arguing that the cracks in their houses had been there for years and they had never encountered any calamities. Mr Kamau said the families were concerned about their safety and security, but added that Government officials were ignorant about the history of the village. “In 2013, we again resisted relocating and heavy rains that caused havoc elsewhere spared our village. We are not leaving our homes to live in makeshift camps,” he said Kamau. Geologists' visit ALSO READ:

Mr Kirui said a final meeting was planned to educate the community on the impending dangers and action would be taken against those defying orders. “If they fail to move out, action will be taken since Kahuro has been listed among the landslide-prone areas. A last meeting will be held to sensitise the public on the dangers,” he said.
