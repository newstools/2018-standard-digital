‘Men more likely to commit suicide’ The biggest population of these dependents at 73.8 per cent were identified as students - who are within the active labour age of 15 to 64 - but are yet to secure jobs. Other dependents are housewives and stay-home husbands who make up family responsibilities (13.1 per cent), the sick and injured (3.5), and just 0.5 per cent who noted there were no jobs available for them. “The age group '25-54' is considered the 'prime age' band representing of the interviewed individuals who are expected to be in labour. Understanding the reasons why they are not in labour is of essence,” the report reads. Other regions with high dependency ratio of over 50 per cent ratio, which translates to high numbers of jobless dependents, are Rift Valley at 90 per cent, Nyanza at 93 per cent, Coast (77 per cent), Eastern (76) and Central (66). The total dependency ratio indicator, the report explains, is used to show the burden that the productive part of the population shoulders. “An increase in the indicator impacts negatively on financial and social welfare of the people. However, this indicator has the limitations that some persons classified as 'dependent' could be producers while others characterised as 'productive' could be economically-dependent,” it notes. According to the report, there are 24.9 million workers and 20.3 million jobless individuals.
