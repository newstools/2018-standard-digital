President Uhuru Kenyatta will tomorrow inaugurate Namanga one-stop border post as part of efforts to secure the country from security threats. Porous land borders have exposed Kenya to proliferation of small arms and light weapons, smuggling of contraband goods as well as piracy on territorial waters. The border post, according to State House Spokesperson Manoah Esipisu, comprises offices and space for immigration processes and verification, customs offices including warehousing and cold rooms for the goods traded across the border, and other facilities for improving trade across the border. In an annual report to Parliament on State of National Security, Uhuru listed operationalisation of One-Stop Border Posts (OSBPs) at Namanga, Taveta, Lungalunga, Busia, Malaba, Isebania and Moyale as part of his administration's efforts to secure the countryâ€™s borders. He said the porous borders had exacerbated movement of illegal immigrants and influx of refugees. Up to Sh60 million has been disbursed for development of Saum border point in Mt Elgon and Lokiriama border point in Turkana.  Other measures Uhuru said his government has taken include establishment of more registration centres and vetting committees in border counties.
