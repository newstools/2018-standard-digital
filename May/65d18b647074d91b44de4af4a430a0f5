Galgalo has since died. Karishu, who was arrested in Kayole, Nairobi, is alleged to have committed the offences on or before February 15 in the city centre. The accused denied the charges before Senior Resident Magistrate Helen Onkwani. The prosecution said the suspect should not be released, as he may abscond due to the seriousness of the charges.
