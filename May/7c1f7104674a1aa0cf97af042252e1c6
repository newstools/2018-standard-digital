A four-year old child died after falling into an open tank filled with water, as he played in Misongeni estate, Makindu. The boy is said to have gone out to play with other children at about 11am on Tuesday, after his mother left him alone in the house. Other children informed their parents that the boy had fallen into the tank, but they found him already dead. “We found the body hours after falling into the uncovered tank at a construction site. Parents should not leave their children unattended,” said area chief Hudderson Kithome. Know if news is factual and true. Text 'NEWS' to 22840 and always receive verified news updates.
